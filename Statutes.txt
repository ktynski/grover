(3)To define clearly the material elements constituting an offense and the accompanying state of mind or criminal intent required for that offense.
(4)To differentiate on reasonable grounds between serious and minor offenses and to establish appropriate disposition for each.
(5)To safeguard conduct that is without fault or legitimate state interest from being condemned as criminal.
(6)To ensure the public safety by deterring the commission of offenses and providing for the opportunity for rehabilitation of those convicted and for their confinement when required in the interests of public protection.

775.021Rules of construction.—
(1)The provisions of this code and offenses defined by other statutes shall be strictly construed; when the language is susceptible of differing constructions, it shall be construed most favorably to the accused.
(2)The provisions of this chapter are applicable to offenses defined by other statutes, unless the code otherwise provides.
(3)This section does not affect the power of a court to punish for contempt or to employ any sanction authorized by law for the enforcement of an order or a civil judgment or decree.
(4)(a)Whoever, in the course of one criminal transaction or episode, commits an act or acts which constitute one or more separate criminal offenses, upon conviction and adjudication of guilt, shall be sentenced separately for each criminal offense; and the sentencing judge may order the sentences to be served concurrently or consecutively. For the purposes of this subsection, offenses are separate if each offense requires proof of an element that the other does not, without regard to the accusatory pleading or the proof adduced at trial.
(b)The intent of the Legislature is to convict and sentence for each criminal offense committed in the course of one criminal episode or transaction and not to allow the principle of lenity as set forth in subsection (1) to determine legislative intent. Exceptions to this rule of construction are:
1.Offenses which require identical elements of proof.
2.Offenses which are degrees of the same offense as provided by statute.
3.Offenses which are lesser offenses the statutory elements of which are subsumed by the greater offense.
(5)Whoever commits an act that violates a provision of this code or commits a criminal offense defined by another statute and thereby causes the death of, or bodily injury to, an unborn child commits a separate offense if the provision or statute does not otherwise specifically provide a separate offense for such death or injury to an unborn child.
(a)Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the punishment for a separate offense under this subsection is the same as the punishment provided under this code or other statute for that conduct had the injury or death occurred to the mother of the unborn child.
(b)An offense under this subsection does not require proof that the person engaging in the conduct:
1.Had knowledge or should have had knowledge that the victim of the underlying offense was pregnant; or
2.Intended to cause the death of, or bodily injury to, the unborn child.
(c)Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the death penalty may not be imposed for an offense under this subsection.
(d)This subsection does not permit the prosecution:
1.Of any person for conduct relating to an abortion for which the consent of the pregnant woman, or a person authorized by law to act on her behalf, has been obtained or for which such consent is implied by law;
2.Of a person for providing medical treatment of the pregnant woman or her unborn child; or
3.Of a woman with respect to her unborn child.
(e)As used in this subsection, the term “unborn child” means a member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.

775.022Effect of reenactment or amendment of criminal statutes; references in criminal statutes.—
(1)It is the intent of the Legislature that:
(a)This section preclude the application of the common law doctrine of abatement to a reenactment or an amendment of a criminal statute; and
(b)An act of the Legislature reenacting or amending a criminal statute not be considered a repeal or an implied repeal of such statute for purposes of s. 9, Art. X of the State Constitution.
(2)As used in this section, the term “criminal statute” means a statute, whether substantive or procedural, dealing in any way with a crime or its punishment, defining a crime or a defense to a crime, or providing for the punishment of a crime.
(3)Except as expressly provided in an act of the Legislature or as provided in subsections (4) and (5), the reenactment or amendment of a criminal statute operates prospectively and does not affect or abate any of the following:
(a)The prior operation of the statute or a prosecution or enforcement thereunder.
(b)A violation of the statute based on any act or omission occurring before the effective date of the act.
(c)A prior penalty, prior forfeiture, or prior punishment incurred or imposed under the statute.
(4)If a penalty, forfeiture, or punishment for a violation of a criminal statute is reduced by a reenactment or an amendment of a criminal statute, the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment, if not already imposed, must be imposed according to the statute as amended.
(5)This section may not be construed to limit the retroactive effect of any defense to a criminal statute enacted or amended by the Legislature in a criminal case that has not yet resulted in the imposition of a judgment or sentence by the trial court or an appellate decision affirming a judgment or sentence of the trial court.
(6)A reference to any other chapter, part, section, or subdivision of the Florida Statutes in a criminal statute or a reference within a criminal statute constitutes a general reference under the doctrine of incorporation by reference.
History.—s. 1, ch. 2019-63.
775.027Insanity defense.—
(1)AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.—All persons are presumed to be sane. It is an affirmative defense to a criminal prosecution that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the defendant was insane. Insanity is established when:
(a)The defendant had a mental infirmity, disease, or defect; and
(b)Because of this condition, the defendant:
1.Did not know what he or she was doing or its consequences; or
2.Although the defendant knew what he or she was doing and its consequences, the defendant did not know that what he or she was doing was wrong.
Mental infirmity, disease, or defect does not constitute a defense of insanity except as provided in this subsection.

(2)BURDEN OF PROOF.—The defendant has the burden of proving the defense of insanity by clear and convincing evidence.
History.—s. 1, ch. 2000-315.
775.03Benefit of clergy.—The doctrine of benefit of clergy shall have no operation in this state.

History.—RS 2349; GS 3173; RGS 5002; CGL 7101; s. 1184, ch. 97-102.
775.051Voluntary intoxication; not a defense; evidence not admissible for certain purposes; exception.—Voluntary intoxication resulting from the consumption, injection, or other use of alcohol or other controlled substance as described in chapter 893 is not a defense to any offense proscribed by law. Evidence of a defendant’s voluntary intoxication is not admissible to show that the defendant lacked the specific intent to commit an offense and is not admissible to show that the defendant was insane at the time of the offense, except when the consumption, injection, or use of a controlled substance under chapter 893 was pursuant to a lawful prescription issued to the defendant by a practitioner as defined in s. 893.02.
History.—s. 1, ch. 99-174; s. 29, ch. 2016-224.
775.08Classes and definitions of offenses.—When used in the laws of this state:

(3)The term “noncriminal violation” shall mean any offense that is punishable under the laws of this state, or that would be punishable if committed in this state, by no other penalty than a fine, forfeiture, or other civil penalty. A noncriminal violation does not constitute a crime, and conviction for a noncriminal violation shall not give rise to any legal disability based on a criminal offense. The term “noncriminal violation” shall not mean any conviction for any violation of any municipal or county ordinance. Nothing contained in this code shall repeal or change the penalty for a violation of any municipal or county ordinance.
(4)The term “crime” shall mean a felony or misdemeanor.

a.In the case of a felony punishable by life, to a term of imprisonment for life;

(g)A sentence imposed under this section shall not be increased after such imposition.
(h)A sentence imposed under this section is not subject to s. 921.002.
(i)The provisions of this section do not apply to capital felonies, and a sentence authorized under this section does not preclude the imposition of the death penalty for a capital felony.
(j)The provisions of s. 947.1405 shall apply to persons sentenced as habitual felony offenders and persons sentenced as habitual violent felony offenders.
(k)1.A defendant sentenced under this section as a habitual felony offender, a habitual violent felony offender, or a violent career criminal is eligible for gain-time granted by the Department of Corrections as provided in s. 944.275(4)(b).
2.For an offense committed on or after October 1, 1995, a defendant sentenced under this section as a violent career criminal is not eligible for any form of discretionary early release, other than pardon or executive clemency, or conditional medical release granted pursuant to s. 947.149.
3.For an offense committed on or after July 1, 1999, a defendant sentenced under this section as a three-time violent felony offender shall be released only by expiration of sentence and shall not be eligible for parole, control release, or any form of early release.

775.0841Legislative findings and intent.—The Legislature finds a substantial and disproportionate number of serious crimes are committed in Florida by a relatively small number of repeat and violent felony offenders, commonly known as career criminals. The Legislature further finds that priority should be given to the investigation, apprehension, and prosecution of career criminals in the use of law enforcement resources and to the incarceration of career criminals in the use of available prison space. The Legislature intends to initiate and support increased efforts by state and local law enforcement agencies and state attorneys’ offices to investigate, apprehend, and prosecute career criminals and to incarcerate them for extended terms; and, in the case of violent career criminals, such extended terms must include substantial mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment.

2.Any person who is convicted of a felony or an attempt to commit a felony listed in subparagraph (a)1., regardless of whether the use of a weapon is an element of the felony, and during the course of the commission of the felony such person discharged a semiautomatic firearm and its high-capacity box magazine or a “machine gun” as defined in s. 790.001 shall be sentenced to a minimum term of imprisonment of 20 years.
3.Any person who is convicted of a felony or an attempt to commit a felony listed in subparagraph (a)1., regardless of whether the use of a weapon is an element of the felony, and during the course of the commission of the felony such person discharged a semiautomatic firearm and its high-capacity box magazine or a “machine gun” as defined in s. 790.001 and, as the result of the discharge, death or great bodily harm was inflicted upon any person, the convicted person shall be sentenced to a minimum term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years and not more than a term of imprisonment of life in prison.
(b)Subparagraph (a)1., subparagraph (a)2., or subparagraph (a)3. does not prevent a court from imposing a longer sentence of incarceration as authorized by law in addition to the minimum mandatory sentence, or from imposing a sentence of death pursuant to other applicable law. Subparagraph (a)1., subparagraph (a)2., or subparagraph (a)3. does not authorize a court to impose a lesser sentence than otherwise required by law.
Notwithstanding s. 948.01, adjudication of guilt or imposition of sentence shall not be suspended, deferred, or withheld, and the defendant is not eligible for statutory gain-time under s. 944.275 or any form of discretionary early release, other than pardon or executive clemency, or conditional medical release under s. 947.149, prior to serving the minimum sentence.

(c)If the minimum mandatory terms of imprisonment imposed pursuant to this section exceed the maximum sentences authorized by s. 775.082, s. 775.084, or the Criminal Punishment Code under chapter 921, then the mandatory minimum sentence must be imposed. If the mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment pursuant to this section are less than the sentences that could be imposed as authorized by s. 775.082, s. 775.084, or the Criminal Punishment Code under chapter 921, then the sentence imposed by the court must include the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment as required in this section.
(d)It is the intent of the Legislature that offenders who possess, carry, display, use, threaten to use, or attempt to use a semiautomatic firearm and its high-capacity detachable box magazine or a machine gun as defined in s. 790.001 be punished to the fullest extent of the law, and the minimum terms of imprisonment imposed pursuant to this subsection shall be imposed for each qualifying felony count for which the person is convicted. The court shall impose any term of imprisonment provided for in this subsection consecutively to any other term of imprisonment imposed for any other felony offense.
(e)As used in this subsection, the term:
1.“High-capacity detachable box magazine” means any detachable box magazine, for use in a semiautomatic firearm, which is capable of being loaded with more than 20 centerfire cartridges.
2.“Semiautomatic firearm” means a firearm which is capable of firing a series of rounds by separate successive depressions of the trigger and which uses the energy of discharge to perform a portion of the operating cycle.
(4)For purposes of imposition of minimum mandatory sentencing provisions of this section, with respect to a firearm, the term “possession” is defined as carrying it on the person. Possession may also be proven by demonstrating that the defendant had the firearm within immediate physical reach with ready access with the intent to use the firearm during the commission of the offense, if proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
(5)This section does not apply to law enforcement officers or to United States military personnel who are performing their lawful duties or who are traveling to or from their places of employment or assignment to perform their lawful duties.

775.0871Public service announcements.—In order to inform the public and to deter and prevent crime, the Office of the Governor shall place public service announcements in areas having the highest representation in the correctional system explaining the penalties provided in this act. In addition, the Office of the Governor shall place public service announcements directed to areas of the state which have the highest rate of firearms-related offenses to maximize the preventative aspects of advertising the penalties imposed by this act.

775.0875Unlawful taking, possession, or use of law enforcement officer’s firearm; crime reclassification; penalties.—
(1)A person who, without authorization, takes a firearm from a law enforcement officer lawfully engaged in law enforcement duties commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

2.In the case of a felony of the second degree, to a felony of the first degree.
3.In the case of a felony of the third degree, to a felony of the second degree.

(o)Sections 787.06(3)(b), (d), (f), and (g), relating to human trafficking,
the court shall order the offender to undergo HIV testing, to be performed under the direction of the Department of Health in accordance with s. 381.004, unless the offender has undergone HIV testing voluntarily or pursuant to procedures established in s. 381.004(2)(h)6. or s. 951.27, or any other applicable law or rule providing for HIV testing of criminal offenders or inmates, subsequent to her or his arrest for an offense enumerated in paragraphs (a)-(n) for which she or he was convicted or to which she or he pled nolo contendere or guilty. The results of an HIV test performed on an offender pursuant to this subsection are not admissible in any criminal proceeding arising out of the alleged offense.

(2)The results of the HIV test must be disclosed under the direction of the Department of Health, to the offender who has been convicted of or pled nolo contendere or guilty to an offense specified in subsection (1), the public health agency of the county in which the conviction occurred and, if different, the county of residence of the offender, and, upon request pursuant to s. 960.003, to the victim or the victim’s legal guardian, or the parent or legal guardian of the victim if the victim is a minor.
(3)An offender who has undergone HIV testing pursuant to subsection (1), and to whom positive test results have been disclosed pursuant to subsection (2), who commits a second or subsequent offense enumerated in paragraphs (1)(a)-(n), commits criminal transmission of HIV, a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

History.—s. 8, ch. 93-227; s. 7, ch. 96-221; s. 2, ch. 96-293; s. 16, ch. 96-322; s. 4, ch. 97-37; s. 1811, ch. 97-102; s. 95, ch. 99-3; s. 291, ch. 99-8; s. 2, ch. 2010-64; s. 4, ch. 2010-113; s. 1, ch. 2010-117; s. 11, ch. 2012-155; s. 127, ch. 2012-184; s. 17, ch. 2014-160; s. 32, ch. 2016-24.
775.089Restitution.—
(1)(a)In addition to any punishment, the court shall order the defendant to make restitution to the victim for:
1.Damage or loss caused directly or indirectly by the defendant’s offense; and
2.Damage or loss related to the defendant’s criminal episode,
unless it finds clear and compelling reasons not to order such restitution. Restitution may be monetary or nonmonetary restitution. The court shall make the payment of restitution a condition of probation in accordance with s. 948.03. An order requiring the defendant to make restitution to a victim does not remove or diminish the requirement that the court order payment to the Crimes Compensation Trust Fund pursuant to chapter 960. Payment of an award by the Crimes Compensation Trust Fund shall create an order of restitution to the Crimes Compensation Trust Fund, unless specifically waived in accordance with subparagraph (b)1.

(b)1.If the court does not order restitution, or orders restitution of only a portion of the damages, as provided in this section, it shall state on the record in detail the reasons therefor.
2.An order of restitution entered as part of a plea agreement is as definitive and binding as any other order of restitution, and a statement to such effect must be made part of the plea agreement. A plea agreement may contain provisions that order restitution relating to criminal offenses committed by the defendant to which the defendant did not specifically enter a plea.
(c)The term “victim” as used in this section and in any provision of law relating to restitution means:
1.Each person who suffers property damage or loss, monetary expense, or physical injury or death as a direct or indirect result of the defendant’s offense or criminal episode, and also includes the victim’s estate if the victim is deceased, and the victim’s next of kin if the victim is deceased as a result of the offense. The term includes governmental entities and political subdivisions, as those terms are defined in s. 11.45, when such entities are a direct victim of the defendant’s offense or criminal episode and not merely providing public services in response to the offense or criminal episode.
2.The term also includes the victim’s trade association if the offense is a violation of s. 540.11(3)(a)3. involving the sale, or possession for purposes of sale, of physical articles and the victim has granted the trade association written authorization to represent the victim’s interests in criminal legal proceedings and to collect restitution on the victim’s behalf. The restitution obligation in this subparagraph relating to violations of s. 540.11(3)(a)3. applies only to physical articles and does not apply to electronic articles or digital files that are distributed or made available online. As used in this subparagraph, the term “trade association” means an organization founded and funded by businesses that operate in a specific industry to protect their collective interests.
(2)(a)When an offense has resulted in bodily injury to a victim, a restitution order entered under subsection (1) shall require that the defendant:
1.Pay the cost of necessary medical and related professional services and devices relating to physical, psychiatric, and psychological care, including nonmedical care and treatment rendered in accordance with a recognized method of healing.
2.Pay the cost of necessary physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation.
3.Reimburse the victim for income lost by the victim as a result of the offense.
4.In the case of an offense which resulted in bodily injury that also resulted in the death of a victim, pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary funeral and related services.
(b)When an offense has not resulted in bodily injury to a victim, a restitution order entered under subsection (1) may require that the defendant reimburse the victim for income lost by the victim as a result of the offense.
(3)(a)The court may require that the defendant make restitution under this section within a specified period or in specified installments.
(b)The end of such period or the last such installment shall not be later than:
1.The end of the period of probation if probation is ordered;
2.Five years after the end of the term of imprisonment imposed if the court does not order probation; or
3.Five years after the date of sentencing in any other case.
(c)Notwithstanding this subsection, a court that has ordered restitution for a misdemeanor offense shall retain jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing the restitution order for any period, not to exceed 5 years, that is pronounced by the court at the time restitution is ordered.
(d)If not otherwise provided by the court under this subsection, restitution must be made immediately.
If the restitution ordered by the court is not made within the time period specified, the court may continue the restitution order through the duration of the civil judgment provision set forth in subsection (5) and as provided in s. 55.10.

(4)If a defendant is placed on probation or paroled, complete satisfaction of any restitution ordered under this section shall be a condition of such probation or parole. The court may revoke probation, and the Florida Commission on Offender Review may revoke parole, if the defendant fails to comply with such order.
(5)An order of restitution may be enforced by the state, or by a victim named in the order to receive the restitution, in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action. The outstanding unpaid amount of the order of restitution bears interest in accordance with s. 55.03, and, when properly recorded, becomes a lien on real estate owned by the defendant. If civil enforcement is necessary, the defendant shall be liable for costs and attorney’s fees incurred by the victim in enforcing the order.
(6)(a)The court, in determining whether to order restitution and the amount of such restitution, shall consider the amount of the loss sustained by any victim as a result of the offense.
(b)The criminal court, at the time of enforcement of the restitution order, shall consider the financial resources of the defendant, the present and potential future financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and his or her dependents, and such other factors which it deems appropriate.
(7)Any dispute as to the proper amount or type of restitution shall be resolved by the court by the preponderance of the evidence. The burden of demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a result of the offense is on the state attorney. The burden of demonstrating the present financial resources and the absence of potential future financial resources of the defendant and the financial needs of the defendant and his or her dependents is on the defendant. The burden of demonstrating such other matters as the court deems appropriate is upon the party designated by the court as justice requires.
(8)The conviction of a defendant for an offense involving the act giving rise to restitution under this section shall estop the defendant from denying the essential allegations of that offense in any subsequent civil proceeding. An order of restitution hereunder will not bar any subsequent civil remedy or recovery, but the amount of such restitution shall be set off against any subsequent independent civil recovery.
(9)When a corporation or unincorporated association is ordered to make restitution, the person authorized to make disbursements from the assets of such corporation or association shall pay restitution from such assets, and such person may be held in contempt for failure to make such restitution.
(10)(a)Any default in payment of restitution may be collected by any means authorized by law for enforcement of a judgment.
(b)The restitution obligation is not subject to discharge in bankruptcy, whether voluntary or involuntary, or to any other statutory or common-law proceeding for relief against creditors.
(11)(a)The court may order the clerk of the court to collect and dispense restitution payments in any case.
(b)The court may order the Department of Corrections to collect and dispense restitution and other payments from persons remanded to its custody or supervision.
(12)(a)Issuance of income deduction order with an order for restitution.—
1.Upon the entry of an order for restitution, the court shall enter a separate order for income deduction if one has not been entered.
2.The income deduction order shall direct a payor to deduct from all income due and payable to the defendant the amount required by the court to meet the defendant’s obligation.
3.The income deduction order shall be effective so long as the order for restitution upon which it is based is effective or until further order of the court.
4.When the court orders the income deduction, the court shall furnish to the defendant a statement of his or her rights, remedies, and duties in regard to the income deduction order. The statement shall state:
a.All fees or interest which shall be imposed.
b.The total amount of income to be deducted for each pay period.
c.That the income deduction order applies to current and subsequent payors and periods of employment.
d.That a copy of the income deduction order will be served on the defendant’s payor or payors.
e.That enforcement of the income deduction order may only be contested on the ground of mistake of fact regarding the amount of restitution owed.
f.That the defendant is required to notify the clerk of court within 7 days after changes in the defendant’s address, payors, and the addresses of his or her payors.
(b)Enforcement of income deduction orders.—
1.The clerk of court or probation officer shall serve an income deduction order and the notice to payor on the defendant’s payor unless the defendant has applied for a hearing to contest the enforcement of the income deduction order.
2.a.Service by or upon any person who is a party to a proceeding under this subsection shall be made in the manner prescribed in the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure for service upon parties.
b.Service upon the defendant’s payor or successor payor under this subsection shall be made by prepaid certified mail, return receipt requested, or in the manner prescribed in chapter 48.
3.The defendant, within 15 days after having an income deduction order entered against him or her, may apply for a hearing to contest the enforcement of the income deduction order on the ground of mistake of fact regarding the amount of restitution owed. The timely request for a hearing shall stay the service of an income deduction order on all payors of the defendant until a hearing is held and a determination is made as to whether the enforcement of the income deduction order is proper.
4.The notice to payor shall contain only information necessary for the payor to comply with the income deduction order. The notice shall:
a.Require the payor to deduct from the defendant’s income the amount specified in the income deduction order and to pay that amount to the clerk of court.
b.Instruct the payor to implement the income deduction order no later than the first payment date which occurs more than 14 days after the date the income deduction order was served on the payor.
c.Instruct the payor to forward within 2 days after each payment date to the clerk of court the amount deducted from the defendant’s income and a statement as to whether the amount totally or partially satisfies the periodic amount specified in the income deduction order.
d.Specify that, if a payor fails to deduct the proper amount from the defendant’s income, the payor is liable for the amount the payor should have deducted plus costs, interest, and reasonable attorney’s fees.
e.Provide that the payor may collect up to $5 against the defendant’s income to reimburse the payor for administrative costs for the first income deduction and up to $2 for each deduction thereafter.
f.State that the income deduction order and the notice to payor are binding on the payor until further notice by the court or until the payor no longer provides income to the defendant.
g.Instruct the payor that, when he or she no longer provides income to the defendant, the payor shall notify the clerk of court and shall also provide the defendant’s last known address and the name and address of the defendant’s new payor, if known, and that, if the payor violates this provision, the payor is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $250 for the first violation or $500 for any subsequent violation.
h.State that the payor shall not discharge, refuse to employ, or take disciplinary action against the defendant because of an income deduction order and shall state that a violation of this provision subjects the payor to a civil penalty not to exceed $250 for the first violation or $500 for any subsequent violation.
i.Inform the payor that, when he or she receives income deduction orders requiring that the income of two or more defendants be deducted and sent to the same clerk of court, the payor may combine the amounts that are to be paid to the depository in a single payment as long as he or she identifies that portion of the payment attributable to each defendant.
j.Inform the payor that if the payor receives more than one income deduction order against the same defendant, he or she shall contact the court for further instructions.
5.The clerk of court shall enforce income deduction orders against the defendant’s successor payor who is located in this state in the same manner prescribed in this subsection for the enforcement of an income deduction order against an original payor.
6.A person may not discharge, refuse to employ, or take disciplinary action against an employee because of the enforcement of an income deduction order. An employer who violates this provision is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $250 for the first violation or $500 for any subsequent violation.
7.When a payor no longer provides income to a defendant, the payor shall notify the clerk of court and shall provide the defendant’s last known address and the name and address of the defendant’s new payor, if known. A payor who violates this provision is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $250 for the first violation or $500 for a subsequent violation.

775.13Registration of convicted felons, exemptions; penalties.—
(1)As used in this section, the term “convicted” means, with respect to a person’s felony offense, a determination of guilt which is the result of a trial or the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld.

If the felony conviction is for an offense that was found, pursuant to s. 874.04, to have been committed for the purpose of benefiting, promoting, or furthering the interests of a criminal gang, the registrant shall identify himself or herself as such an offender. The Department of Law Enforcement, in consultation with appropriate local law enforcement agencies, may develop standardized practices for the inclusion of gang affiliation at the time of offender registration.
(3)Any person who has been convicted of a crime in any federal court or in any court of a state other than Florida, or of any foreign state or country, which crime if committed in Florida would be a felony, shall forthwith within 48 hours after entering any county in this state register with the sheriff of said county in the same manner as provided for in subsection (2).

(a)Who has had his or her civil rights restored;
(b)Who has received a full pardon for the offense for which convicted;
(c)Who has been lawfully released from incarceration or other sentence or supervision for a felony conviction for more than 5 years prior to such time for registration, unless the offender is a fugitive from justice on a felony charge or has been convicted of any offense since release from such incarceration or other sentence or supervision;
(d)Who is a parolee or probationer under the supervision of the United States Parole Commission if the commission knows of and consents to the presence of the offender in Florida or is a probationer under the supervision of any federal probation officer in the state or who has been lawfully discharged from such parole or probation;

(1)A prosecution for a capital felony, a life felony, or a felony that resulted in a death may be commenced at any time. If the death penalty is held to be unconstitutional by the Florida Supreme Court or the United States Supreme Court, all crimes designated as capital felonies shall be considered life felonies for the purposes of this section, and prosecution for such crimes may be commenced at any time.
(2)Except as otherwise provided in this section, prosecutions for other offenses are subject to the following periods of limitation:
(a)A prosecution for a felony of the first degree must be commenced within 4 years after it is committed.
(b)A prosecution for any other felony must be commenced within 3 years after it is committed.
(c)A prosecution for a misdemeanor of the first degree must be commenced within 2 years after it is committed.
(d)A prosecution for a misdemeanor of the second degree or a noncriminal violation must be commenced within 1 year after it is committed.
(3)An offense is committed either when every element has occurred or, if a legislative purpose to prohibit a continuing course of conduct plainly appears, at the time when the course of conduct or the defendant’s complicity therein is terminated. Time starts to run on the day after the offense is committed.
(4)(a)Prosecution on a charge on which the defendant has previously been arrested or served with a summons is commenced by the filing of an indictment, information, or other charging document.
(b)A prosecution on a charge on which the defendant has not previously been arrested or served with a summons is commenced when either an indictment or information is filed, provided the capias, summons, or other process issued on such indictment or information is executed without unreasonable delay. In determining what is reasonable, inability to locate the defendant after diligent search or the defendant’s absence from the state shall be considered. The failure to execute process on or extradite a defendant in another state who has been charged by information or indictment with a crime in this state shall not constitute an unreasonable delay.
(c)If, however, an indictment or information has been filed within the time period prescribed in this section and the indictment or information is dismissed or set aside because of a defect in its content or form after the time period has elapsed, the period for commencing prosecution shall be extended 3 months from the time the indictment or information is dismissed or set aside.
(5)The period of limitation does not run during any time when the defendant is continuously absent from the state or has no reasonably ascertainable place of abode or work within the state. This provision shall not extend the period of limitation otherwise applicable by more than 3 years, but shall not be construed to limit the prosecution of a defendant who has been timely charged by indictment or information or other charging document and who has not been arrested due to his or her absence from this state or has not been extradited for prosecution from another state.
(6)A prosecution for perjury in an official proceeding that relates to the prosecution of a capital felony may be commenced at any time.

(12)If the period prescribed in subsection (2), subsection (8), subsection (9), subsection (10), or subsection (11) has expired, a prosecution may nevertheless be commenced for:
(a)Any offense, a material element of which is either fraud or a breach of fiduciary obligation, within 1 year after discovery of the offense by an aggrieved party or by a person who has a legal duty to represent an aggrieved party and who is himself or herself not a party to the offense, but in no case shall this provision extend the period of limitation otherwise applicable by more than 3 years.
(b)Any offense based upon misconduct in office by a public officer or employee at any time when the defendant is in public office or employment, within 2 years from the time he or she leaves public office or employment, or during any time permitted by any other part of this section, whichever time is greater.

775.21The Florida Sexual Predators Act.—
(1)SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as “The Florida Sexual Predators Act.”
(2)DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section, the term:
(a)“Change in status at an institution of higher education” means the commencement or termination of enrollment, including, but not limited to, traditional classroom setting or online courses, or employment, whether for compensation or as a volunteer, at an institution of higher education or a change in location of enrollment or employment, whether for compensation or as a volunteer, at an institution of higher education.
(b)“Chief of police” means the chief law enforcement officer of a municipality.

(d)“Community” means any county where the sexual predator lives or otherwise establishes or maintains a permanent, temporary, or transient residence.
(e)“Conviction” means a determination of guilt which is the result of a trial or the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld. A conviction for a similar offense includes, but is not limited to, a conviction by a federal or military tribunal, including courts-martial conducted by the Armed Forces of the United States, and includes a conviction or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere resulting in a sanction in any state of the United States or other jurisdiction. A sanction includes, but is not limited to, a fine, probation, community control, parole, conditional release, control release, or incarceration in a state prison, federal prison, private correctional facility, or local detention facility.
(f)“Department” means the Department of Law Enforcement.

(j)“Internet identifier” means any designation, moniker, screen name, username, or other name used for self-identification to send or receive social Internet communication. Internet identifier does not include a date of birth, social security number, personal identification number (PIN), or password. A sexual offender’s or sexual predator’s use of an Internet identifier that discloses his or her date of birth, social security number, personal identification number (PIN), password, or other information that would reveal the identity of the sexual offender or sexual predator waives the disclosure exemption in this paragraph for such personal information.
(k)“Permanent residence” means a place where the person abides, lodges, or resides for 3 or more consecutive days.
(l)“Professional license” means the document of authorization or certification issued by an agency of this state for a regulatory purpose, or by any similar agency in another jurisdiction for a regulatory purpose, to a person to engage in an occupation or to carry out a trade or business.
(m)“Social Internet communication” means any communication through a commercial social networking website as defined in s. 943.0437, or application software. The term does not include any of the following:
1.Communication for which the primary purpose is the facilitation of commercial transactions involving goods or services;
2.Communication on an Internet website for which the primary purpose of the website is the dissemination of news; or
3.Communication with a governmental entity.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term “application software” means any computer program designed to run on a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet computer, that allows users to create web pages or profiles that provide information about themselves and are available publicly or to other users, and that offers a mechanism for communication with other users through a forum, a chatroom, electronic mail, or an instant messenger.

(n)“Temporary residence” means a place where the person abides, lodges, or resides, including, but not limited to, vacation, business, or personal travel destinations in or out of this state, for a period of 3 or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and which is not the person’s permanent address or, for a person whose permanent residence is not in this state, a place where the person is employed, practices a vocation, or is enrolled as a student for any period of time in this state.
(o)“Transient residence” means a county where a person lives, remains, or is located for a period of 3 or more days in the aggregate during a calendar year and which is not the person’s permanent or temporary address. The term includes, but is not limited to, a place where the person sleeps or seeks shelter and a location that has no specific street address.
(p)“Vehicles owned” means any motor vehicle as defined in s. 320.01, which is registered, coregistered, leased, titled, or rented by a sexual predator or sexual offender; a rented vehicle that a sexual predator or sexual offender is authorized to drive; or a vehicle for which a sexual predator or sexual offender is insured as a driver. The term also includes any motor vehicle as defined in s. 320.01, which is registered, coregistered, leased, titled, or rented by a person or persons residing at a sexual predator’s or sexual offender’s permanent residence for 5 or more consecutive days.
(3)LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE; LEGISLATIVE INTENT.—
(a)Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant.
(b)The high level of threat that a sexual predator presents to the public safety, and the long-term effects suffered by victims of sex offenses, provide the state with sufficient justification to implement a strategy that includes:
1.Incarcerating sexual predators and maintaining adequate facilities to ensure that decisions to release sexual predators into the community are not made on the basis of inadequate space.
2.Providing for specialized supervision of sexual predators who are in the community by specially trained probation officers with low caseloads, as described in ss. 947.1405(7) and 948.30. The sexual predator is subject to specified terms and conditions implemented at sentencing or at the time of release from incarceration, with a requirement that those who are financially able must pay all or part of the costs of supervision.
3.Requiring the registration of sexual predators, with a requirement that complete and accurate information be maintained and accessible for use by law enforcement authorities, communities, and the public.
4.Providing for community and public notification concerning the presence of sexual predators.
5.Prohibiting sexual predators from working with children, either for compensation or as a volunteer.
(c)The state has a compelling interest in protecting the public from sexual predators and in protecting children from predatory sexual activity, and there is sufficient justification for requiring sexual predators to register and for requiring community and public notification of the presence of sexual predators.
(d)It is the purpose of the Legislature that, upon the court’s written finding that an offender is a sexual predator, in order to protect the public, it is necessary that the sexual predator be registered with the department and that members of the community and the public be notified of the sexual predator’s presence. The designation of a person as a sexual predator is neither a sentence nor a punishment but simply a status resulting from the conviction of certain crimes.
(e)It is the intent of the Legislature to address the problem of sexual predators by:
1.Requiring sexual predators supervised in the community to have special conditions of supervision and to be supervised by probation officers with low caseloads;
2.Requiring sexual predators to register with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, as provided in this section; and
3.Requiring community and public notification of the presence of a sexual predator, as provided in this section.
(4)SEXUAL PREDATOR CRITERIA.—
(a)For a current offense committed on or after October 1, 1993, upon conviction, an offender shall be designated as a “sexual predator” under subsection (5), and subject to registration under subsection (6) and community and public notification under subsection (7) if:

2.The offender has not received a pardon for any felony or similar law of another jurisdiction that is necessary for the operation of this paragraph; and
3.A conviction of a felony or similar law of another jurisdiction necessary to the operation of this paragraph has not been set aside in any postconviction proceeding.
(b)In order to be counted as a prior felony for purposes of this subsection, the felony must have resulted in a conviction sentenced separately, or an adjudication of delinquency entered separately, prior to the current offense and sentenced or adjudicated separately from any other felony conviction that is to be counted as a prior felony regardless of the date of offense of the prior felony.
(c)If an offender has been registered as a sexual predator by the Department of Corrections, the department, or any other law enforcement agency and if:
1.The court did not, for whatever reason, make a written finding at the time of sentencing that the offender was a sexual predator; or
2.The offender was administratively registered as a sexual predator because the Department of Corrections, the department, or any other law enforcement agency obtained information that indicated that the offender met the criteria for designation as a sexual predator based on a violation of a similar law in another jurisdiction,
the department shall remove that offender from the department’s list of sexual predators and, for an offender described under subparagraph 1., shall notify the state attorney who prosecuted the offense that met the criteria for administrative designation as a sexual predator, and, for an offender described under this paragraph, shall notify the state attorney of the county where the offender establishes or maintains a permanent, temporary, or transient residence. The state attorney shall bring the matter to the court’s attention in order to establish that the offender meets the criteria for designation as a sexual predator. If the court makes a written finding that the offender is a sexual predator, the offender must be designated as a sexual predator, must register or be registered as a sexual predator with the department as provided in subsection (6), and is subject to the community and public notification as provided in subsection (7). If the court does not make a written finding that the offender is a sexual predator, the offender may not be designated as a sexual predator with respect to that offense and is not required to register or be registered as a sexual predator with the department.

(d)An offender who has been determined to be a sexually violent predator pursuant to a civil commitment proceeding under chapter 394 shall be designated as a “sexual predator” under subsection (5) and subject to registration under subsection (6) and community and public notification under subsection (7).
(5)SEXUAL PREDATOR DESIGNATION.—An offender is designated as a sexual predator as follows:
(a)1.An offender who meets the sexual predator criteria described in paragraph (4)(d) is a sexual predator, and the court shall make a written finding at the time such offender is determined to be a sexually violent predator under chapter 394 that such person meets the criteria for designation as a sexual predator for purposes of this section. The clerk shall transmit a copy of the order containing the written finding to the department within 48 hours after the entry of the order;
2.An offender who meets the sexual predator criteria described in paragraph (4)(a) who is before the court for sentencing for a current offense committed on or after October 1, 1993, is a sexual predator, and the sentencing court must make a written finding at the time of sentencing that the offender is a sexual predator, and the clerk of the court shall transmit a copy of the order containing the written finding to the department within 48 hours after the entry of the order; or
3.If the Department of Corrections, the department, or any other law enforcement agency obtains information which indicates that an offender who establishes or maintains a permanent, temporary, or transient residence in this state meets the sexual predator criteria described in paragraph (4)(a) or paragraph (4)(d) because the offender was civilly committed or committed a similar violation in another jurisdiction on or after October 1, 1993, the Department of Corrections, the department, or the law enforcement agency shall notify the state attorney of the county where the offender establishes or maintains a permanent, temporary, or transient residence of the offender’s presence in the community. The state attorney shall file a petition with the criminal division of the circuit court for the purpose of holding a hearing to determine if the offender’s criminal record or record of civil commitment from another jurisdiction meets the sexual predator criteria. If the court finds that the offender meets the sexual predator criteria because the offender has violated a similar law or similar laws in another jurisdiction, the court shall make a written finding that the offender is a sexual predator.
When the court makes a written finding that an offender is a sexual predator, the court shall inform the sexual predator of the registration and community and public notification requirements described in this section. Within 48 hours after the court designating an offender as a sexual predator, the clerk of the circuit court shall transmit a copy of the court’s written sexual predator finding to the department. If the offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment or supervision, a copy of the court’s written sexual predator finding must be submitted to the Department of Corrections.

(b)If a sexual predator is not sentenced to a term of imprisonment, the clerk of the court shall ensure that the sexual predator’s fingerprints are taken and forwarded to the department within 48 hours after the court renders its written sexual predator finding. The fingerprints shall be clearly marked, “Sexual Predator Registration.” The clerk of the court that convicts and sentences the sexual predator for the offense or offenses described in subsection (4) shall forward to the department and to the Department of Corrections a certified copy of any order entered by the court imposing any special condition or restriction on the sexual predator that restricts or prohibits access to the victim, if the victim is a minor, or to other minors.
(c)If the Department of Corrections, the department, or any other law enforcement agency obtains information which indicates that an offender meets the sexual predator criteria but the court did not make a written finding that the offender is a sexual predator as required in paragraph (a), the Department of Corrections, the department, or the law enforcement agency shall notify the state attorney who prosecuted the offense for offenders described in subparagraph (a)1., or the state attorney of the county where the offender establishes or maintains a residence upon first entering the state for offenders described in subparagraph (a)3. The state attorney shall bring the matter to the court’s attention in order to establish that the offender meets the sexual predator criteria. If the state attorney fails to establish that an offender meets the sexual predator criteria and the court does not make a written finding that an offender is a sexual predator, the offender is not required to register with the department as a sexual predator. The Department of Corrections, the department, or any other law enforcement agency shall not administratively designate an offender as a sexual predator without a written finding from the court that the offender is a sexual predator.
(d)A person who establishes or maintains a residence in this state and who has not been designated as a sexual predator by a court of this state but who has been designated as a sexual predator, as a sexually violent predator, or by another sexual offender designation in another state or jurisdiction and was, as a result of such designation, subjected to registration or community or public notification, or both, or would be if the person was a resident of that state or jurisdiction, without regard to whether the person otherwise meets the criteria for registration as a sexual offender, shall register in the manner provided in s. 943.0435 or s. 944.607 and shall be subject to community and public notification as provided in s. 943.0435 or s. 944.607. A person who meets the criteria of this section is subject to the requirements and penalty provisions of s. 943.0435 or s. 944.607 until the person provides the department with an order issued by the court that designated the person as a sexual predator, as a sexually violent predator, or by another sexual offender designation in the state or jurisdiction in which the order was issued which states that such designation has been removed or demonstrates to the department that such designation, if not imposed by a court, has been removed by operation of law or court order in the state or jurisdiction in which the designation was made, and provided such person no longer meets the criteria for registration as a sexual offender under the laws of this state.

Each sheriff’s office shall establish procedures for reporting transient residence information and provide notice to transient registrants to report transient residence information as required in this sub-subparagraph. Reporting to the sheriff’s office as required by this sub-subparagraph does not exempt registrants from any reregistration requirement.

Any travel that is not known by the sexual predator 21 days before the departure date must be reported to the sheriff’s office as soon as possible before departure. The sexual predator shall provide to the sheriff the address, municipality, county, state, and country of intended residence.

A sexual predator who reports his or her intent to establish a permanent, temporary, or transient residence in another state, a jurisdiction other than the State of Florida, or another country, but who remains in this state without reporting to the sheriff in the manner required by this paragraph, commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.
(k)1.The department is responsible for the online maintenance of current information regarding each registered sexual predator. The department shall maintain hotline access for state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies to obtain instantaneous locator file and offender characteristics information on all released registered sexual predators for purposes of monitoring, tracking, and prosecution. The photograph, palm prints, and fingerprints do not have to be stored in a computerized format.
2.The department’s sexual predator registration list, containing the information described in subparagraph (a)1., is a public record, unless otherwise made exempt or confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1) and s. 24(a) of Art. I of the State Constitution. The department may disseminate this public information by any means deemed appropriate, including operating a toll-free telephone number for this purpose. When the department provides information regarding a registered sexual predator to the public, department personnel shall advise the person making the inquiry that positive identification of a person believed to be a sexual predator cannot be established unless a fingerprint comparison is made, and that it is illegal to use public information regarding a registered sexual predator to facilitate the commission of a crime.
3.The department shall adopt guidelines as necessary regarding the registration of sexual predators and the dissemination of information regarding sexual predators as required by this section.
(l)A sexual predator shall maintain registration with the department for the duration of his or her life, unless the sexual predator has received a full pardon or has had a conviction set aside in a postconviction proceeding for any offense that met the criteria for the sexual predator designation.

The system must be consistent with the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 and any other federal standards applicable to such verification or required to be met as a condition for the receipt of federal funds by the state. The Department of Corrections shall verify the addresses of sexual predators who are not incarcerated but who reside in the community under the supervision of the Department of Corrections and shall report to the department any failure by a sexual predator to comply with registration requirements. County and local law enforcement agencies, in conjunction with the department, shall verify the addresses of sexual predators who are not under the care, custody, control, or supervision of the Department of Corrections, and may verify the addresses of sexual predators who are under the care, custody, control, or supervision of the Department of Corrections. Local law enforcement agencies shall report to the department any failure by a sexual predator to comply with registration requirements.
(a)A sexual predator shall report in person each year during the month of the sexual predator’s birthday and during every third month thereafter to the sheriff’s office in the county in which he or she resides or is otherwise located to reregister. The sheriff’s office may determine the appropriate times and days for reporting by the sexual predator, which must be consistent with the reporting requirements of this paragraph. Reregistration must include any changes to the following information:

(a)Except as otherwise specifically provided, a sexual predator who fails to register; who fails, after registration, to maintain, acquire, or renew a driver license or an identification card; who fails to provide required location information; who fails to provide electronic mail addresses, Internet identifiers, and each Internet identifier’s corresponding website homepage or application software name; who fails to provide all home telephone numbers and cellular telephone numbers, employment information, change in status at an institution of higher education, or change-of-name information; who fails to make a required report in connection with vacating a permanent residence; who fails to reregister as required; who fails to respond to any address verification correspondence from the department within 3 weeks of the date of the correspondence; who knowingly provides false registration information by act or omission; or who otherwise fails, by act or omission, to comply with the requirements of this section commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.
(b)A sexual predator who has been convicted of or found to have committed, or has pled nolo contendere or guilty to, regardless of adjudication, any violation, or attempted violation, of s. 787.01, s. 787.02, or s. 787.025(2)(c), where the victim is a minor; s. 794.011, excluding s. 794.011(10); s. 794.05; former s. 796.03; former s. 796.035; s. 800.04; s. 827.071; s. 847.0133; s. 847.0135(5); s. 847.0145; or s. 985.701(1); or a violation of a similar law of another jurisdiction when the victim of the offense was a minor, and who works, whether for compensation or as a volunteer, at any business, school, child care facility, park, playground, or other place where children regularly congregate, commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.
(c)For a felony violation of this section, excluding paragraph (g), committed on or after July 1, 2018, if the court does not impose a prison sentence, the court shall impose a mandatory minimum term of community control, as defined in s. 948.001, as follows:
1.For a first offense, a mandatory minimum term of 6 months with electronic monitoring.
2.For a second offense, a mandatory minimum term of 1 year with electronic monitoring.
3.For a third or subsequent offense, a mandatory minimum term of 2 years with electronic monitoring.
(d)Any person who misuses public records information relating to a sexual predator, as defined in this section, or a sexual offender, as defined in s. 943.0435 or s. 944.607, to secure a payment from such a predator or offender; who knowingly distributes or publishes false information relating to such a predator or offender which the person misrepresents as being public records information; or who materially alters public records information with the intent to misrepresent the information, including documents, summaries of public records information provided by law enforcement agencies, or public records information displayed by law enforcement agencies on websites or provided through other means of communication, commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.
(e)A sexual predator who commits any act or omission in violation of this section may be prosecuted for the act or omission in the county in which the act or omission was committed, in the county of the last registered address of the sexual predator, in the county in which the conviction occurred for the offense or offenses that meet the criteria for designating a person as a sexual predator, in the county where the sexual predator was released from incarceration, or in the county of the intended address of the sexual predator as reported by the predator prior to his or her release from incarceration. In addition, a sexual predator may be prosecuted for any such act or omission in the county in which he or she was designated a sexual predator.
(f)An arrest on charges of failure to register, the service of an information or a complaint for a violation of this section, or an arraignment on charges for a violation of this section constitutes actual notice of the duty to register when the predator has been provided and advised of his or her statutory obligation to register under subsection (6). A sexual predator’s failure to immediately register as required by this section following such arrest, service, or arraignment constitutes grounds for a subsequent charge of failure to register. A sexual predator charged with the crime of failure to register who asserts, or intends to assert, a lack of notice of the duty to register as a defense to a charge of failure to register shall immediately register as required by this section. A sexual predator who is charged with a subsequent failure to register may not assert the defense of a lack of notice of the duty to register. Registration following such arrest, service, or arraignment is not a defense and does not relieve the sexual predator of criminal liability for the failure to register.
(g)Any person who has reason to believe that a sexual predator is not complying, or has not complied, with the requirements of this section and who, with the intent to assist the sexual predator in eluding a law enforcement agency that is seeking to find the sexual predator to question the sexual predator about, or to arrest the sexual predator for, his or her noncompliance with the requirements of this section:
1.Withholds information from, or does not notify, the law enforcement agency about the sexual predator’s noncompliance with the requirements of this section, and, if known, the whereabouts of the sexual predator;
2.Harbors, or attempts to harbor, or assists another person in harboring or attempting to harbor, the sexual predator;
3.Conceals or attempts to conceal, or assists another person in concealing or attempting to conceal, the sexual predator; or
4.Provides information to the law enforcement agency regarding the sexual predator which the person knows to be false information,
commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

775.24Duty of the court to uphold laws governing sexual predators and sexual offenders.—
(1)The Legislature finds that, for the purpose of approving a plea agreement or for other reasons, certain courts enter orders that effectively limit or nullify requirements imposed upon sexual predators and sexual offenders pursuant to the laws of this state and prevent persons or entities from carrying out the duties imposed, or exercising the authority conferred, by such laws. The laws relating to sexual predators and sexual offenders are substantive law. Furthermore, the Congress of the United States has expressly encouraged every state to enact such laws, and has provided that, to the extent that a state’s laws do not meet certain federal requirements, the state will lose significant federal funding provided to the state for law enforcement and public safety programs. Unless a court that enters such an order determines that a person or entity is not operating in accordance with the laws governing sexual predators or sexual offenders, or that such laws or any part of such laws are unconstitutional or unconstitutionally applied, the court unlawfully encroaches on the Legislature’s exclusive power to make laws and places at risk significant public interests of the state.
(2)If a person meets the criteria in this chapter for designation as a sexual predator or meets the criteria in s. 943.0435, s. 944.606, s. 944.607, or any other law for classification as a sexual offender, the court may not enter an order, for the purpose of approving a plea agreement or for any other reason, which:
(a)Exempts a person who meets the criteria for designation as a sexual predator or classification as a sexual offender from such designation or classification, or exempts such person from the requirements for registration or community and public notification imposed upon sexual predators and sexual offenders;
(b)Restricts the compiling, reporting, or release of public records information that relates to sexual predators or sexual offenders; or
(c)Prevents any person or entity from performing its duties or operating within its statutorily conferred authority as such duty or authority relates to sexual predators or sexual offenders.
(3)If the court enters an order that affects an agency’s performance of a duty imposed under the laws governing sexual predators or sexual offenders, or that limits the agency’s exercise of authority conferred under such laws, the Legislature strongly encourages the affected agency to file a motion in the court that entered such order. The affected agency may, within 1 year after the receipt of any such order, move to modify or set aside the order or, if such order is in the nature of an injunction, move to dissolve the injunction. Grounds for granting any such motion include, but need not be limited to:
(a)The affected agency was not properly noticed.
(b)The court is not authorized to enjoin the operation of a statute that has been duly adjudged constitutional and operative unless the statute is illegally applied or unless the statute or the challenged part of it is unconstitutional on adjudicated grounds.
(c)Jurisdiction may not be conferred by consent of the parties.
(d)To the extent that the order is based upon actions the agency might take, the court’s order is premature and, if and when such actions are taken, these actions may be challenged in appropriate proceedings to determine their enforceability.
(e)The injunction affects the public interest and would cause injury to the public.
(f)The order creates an unenforceable, perpetual injunction.
(g)The order seeks to restrict the agency in the performance of its duties outside the court’s territorial jurisdiction.

775.25Prosecutions for acts or omissions.—A sexual predator or sexual offender who commits any act or omission in violation of s. 775.21, s. 943.0435, s. 944.605, s. 944.606, s. 944.607, or former s. 947.177 may be prosecuted for the act or omission in the county in which the act or omission was committed, in the county of the last registered address of the sexual predator or sexual offender, in the county in which the conviction occurred for the offense or offenses that meet the criteria for designating a person as a sexual predator or sexual offender, in the county where the sexual predator or sexual offender was released from incarceration, or in the county of the intended address of the sexual predator or sexual offender as reported by the predator or offender prior to his or her release from incarceration. In addition, a sexual predator may be prosecuted for any such act or omission in the county in which he or she was designated a sexual predator.

775.26Registration of career offenders and public notification; legislative findings and intent.—The Legislature finds that certain career offenders, by virtue of their histories of offenses, present a threat to the public and to communities. The Legislature finds that requiring these career offenders to register for the purpose of tracking these career offenders and that providing for notifying the public and a community of the presence of a career offender are important aids to law enforcement agencies, the public, and communities if a career offender engages again in criminal conduct. Registration is intended to aid law enforcement agencies in timely apprehending a career offender. Registration is not a punishment, but merely a status. Notification to the public and communities of the presence of a career offender aids the public and communities in avoiding being victimized by a career offender. The Legislature intends to require the registration of career offenders and to authorize law enforcement agencies to notify the public and communities of the presence of a career offender.

The sheriff shall promptly provide to the department the information received from the career offender. The failure of a career offender to provide his or her intended place of residence is punishable as provided in subsection (8).
(g)A career offender who indicates his or her intent to reside in a state or jurisdiction other than the State of Florida and later decides to remain in this state shall, within 2 working days after the date upon which the career offender indicated he or she would leave this state, report in person to the sheriff or the department, whichever agency is the agency to which the career offender reported the intended change of residence, of his or her intent to remain in this state. If the sheriff is notified by the career offender that he or she intends to remain in this state, the sheriff shall promptly report this information to the department. A career offender who reports his or her intent to reside in a state or jurisdiction other than the State of Florida, but who remains in this state without reporting to the sheriff or the department in the manner required by this paragraph, commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.
(h)1.The department shall maintain online computer access to the current information regarding each registered career offender.

The photograph and fingerprints need not be stored in a computerized format.
2.The department’s career offender registration list, containing the information described in subparagraph (a)1., is a public record. The department may disseminate this public information by any means deemed appropriate, including operating a toll-free telephone number for this purpose. When the department provides information regarding a career offender to the public, department personnel must advise the person making the inquiry that positive identification of a person believed to be a career offender cannot be established unless a fingerprint comparison is made, and that it is illegal to use public information regarding a career offender to facilitate the commission of a crime.
3.The department shall adopt guidelines as necessary regarding the registration of a career offender and the dissemination of information regarding a career offender as required by this section.
(i)A career offender must maintain registration with the department for the duration of his or her life, unless the career offender has received a full pardon or has had a conviction set aside in a postconviction proceeding for any offense that meets the criteria for classifying the person as a career offender for purposes of registration. However, a registered career offender who has been lawfully released from confinement, supervision, or sanction, whichever is later, for at least 20 years and has not been arrested for any felony or misdemeanor offense since release may petition the criminal division of the circuit court of the circuit in which the registered career offender resides for the purpose of removing the requirement for registration as a career offender. The court may grant or deny such relief if the registered career offender demonstrates to the court that he or she has not been arrested for any crime since release and the court is otherwise satisfied that the registered career offender is not a current or potential threat to public safety. The state attorney in the circuit in which the petition is filed must be given notice of the petition at least 3 weeks before the hearing on the matter. The state attorney may present evidence in opposition to the requested relief or may otherwise demonstrate the reasons why the petition should be denied. If the court denies the petition, the court may set a future date at which the registered career offender may again petition the court for relief, subject to the standards for relief provided in this paragraph. The department shall remove a person from classification as a career offender for purposes of registration if the person provides to the department a certified copy of the court’s written findings or order that indicates that the person is no longer required to comply with the requirements for registration as a career offender.
(5)COMMUNITY AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION.—
(a)Law enforcement agencies may inform the community and the public of the presence of a career offender in the community. Upon notification of the presence of a career offender, the sheriff of the county or the chief of police of the municipality where the career offender establishes or maintains a permanent or temporary residence may notify the community and the public of the presence of the career offender in a manner deemed appropriate by the sheriff or the chief of police.
(b)The sheriff or the police chief may coordinate the community and public notification efforts with the department. Statewide notification to the public is authorized, as deemed appropriate by local law enforcement personnel and the department.
(6)VERIFICATION.—The department and the Department of Corrections shall implement a system for verifying the addresses of career offenders. The sheriff of each county shall annually verify the addresses of career offenders who are not under the care, custody, control, or supervision of the Department of Corrections. The sheriff shall promptly provide the address verification information to the department in an electronic format. The address verification information must include the verifying person’s name, agency, and phone number, the date of verification, and the method of verification, and must specify whether the address information was verified as correct, incorrect, or unconfirmed.
(7)IMMUNITY.—The department, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the Department of Corrections, any law enforcement agency in this state, and the personnel of those departments; an elected or appointed official, public employee, or school administrator; or an employee, agency, or any individual or entity acting at the request or upon the direction of any law enforcement agency is immune from civil liability for damages for good faith compliance with the requirements of this section or for the release of information under this section and shall be presumed to have acted in good faith in compiling, recording, reporting, or releasing the information. The presumption of good faith is not overcome if a technical or clerical error is made by the department, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the Department of Corrections, the personnel of those departments, or any individual or entity acting at the request or upon the direction of any of those departments in compiling or providing information, or if information is incomplete or incorrect because a career offender fails to report or falsely reports his or her current place of permanent or temporary residence.
(8)PENALTIES.—
(a)Except as otherwise specifically provided, a career offender who fails to register; who fails, after registration, to maintain, acquire, or renew a driver license or identification card; who fails to provide required location information or change-of-name information; or who otherwise fails, by act or omission, to comply with the requirements of this section, commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.
(b)Any person who misuses public records information concerning a career offender, as defined in this section, or a career offender, as defined in s. 944.608 or s. 944.609, to secure a payment from such career offender; who knowingly distributes or publishes false information concerning such a career offender which the person misrepresents as being public records information; or who materially alters public records information with the intent to misrepresent the information, including documents, summaries of public records information provided by law enforcement agencies, or public records information displayed by law enforcement agencies on websites or provided through other means of communication, commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.
(9)PROSECUTIONS FOR ACTS OR OMISSIONS.—A career offender who commits any act or omission in violation of this section, s. 944.608, or s. 944.609 may be prosecuted for the act or omission in the county in which the act or omission was committed, the county of the last registered address of the career offender, the county in which the conviction occurred for the offense or offenses that meet the criteria for designating a person as a career offender, or in the county in which he or she was designated a career offender.
(10)ASSISTING IN NONCOMPLIANCE.—It is a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083, for a person who has reason to believe that a career offender is not complying, or has not complied, with the requirements of this section and who, with the intent to assist the career offender in eluding a law enforcement agency that is seeking to find the career offender to question the career offender about, or to arrest the career offender for, his or her noncompliance with the requirements of this section, to:
(a)Withhold information from, or fail to notify, the law enforcement agency about the career offender’s noncompliance with the requirements of this section and, if known, the whereabouts of the career offender;

The officer shall submit the report to the supervisor or other person to whom the employer’s rules or policies require reports of similar allegations of criminal activity to be made. The law enforcement agency shall, without charge, send a copy of the initial police report, as well as any subsequent, supplemental, or related report, which excludes victim or witness statements or other materials that are part of an active criminal investigation and are exempt from disclosure under chapter 119, to the nearest locally certified domestic violence center within 24 hours after the agency’s receipt of the report. The report furnished to the domestic violence center must include a narrative description of the dating violence incident.

(13)Whenever a law enforcement officer determines upon probable cause that an act of dating violence has been committed within the jurisdiction, or that a person has violated a condition of pretrial release as provided in s. 903.047 and the original arrest was for an act of dating violence, the officer may arrest the person or persons suspected of its commission and charge such person or persons with the appropriate crime. The decision to arrest and charge shall not require consent of the victim or consideration of the relationship of the parties.
(14)(a)When complaints are received from two or more parties, the officers shall evaluate each complaint separately to determine whether there is probable cause for arrest.
(b)If a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that two or more persons have committed a misdemeanor or felony, or if two or more persons make complaints to the officer, the officer shall try to determine who was the primary aggressor. Arrest is the preferred response only with respect to the primary aggressor and not the preferred response with respect to a person who acts in a reasonable manner to protect or defend himself or herself or another family or household member from dating violence.
(15)A person who willfully violates a condition of pretrial release provided in s. 903.047, when the original arrest was for an act of dating violence as defined in this section, commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083, and shall be held in custody until his or her first appearance.
(16)A law enforcement officer acting in good faith under this section and the officer’s employing agency shall be immune from all liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise be incurred or imposed by reason of the officer’s or agency’s actions in carrying out the provisions of this section.

784.048Stalking; definitions; penalties.—

(c)“Credible threat” means a verbal or nonverbal threat, or a combination of the two, including threats delivered by electronic communication or implied by a pattern of conduct, which places the person who is the target of the threat in reasonable fear for his or her safety or the safety of his or her family members or individuals closely associated with the person, and which is made with the apparent ability to carry out the threat to cause such harm. It is not necessary to prove that the person making the threat had the intent to actually carry out the threat. The present incarceration of the person making the threat is not a bar to prosecution under this section.
(d)“Cyberstalk” means:
1.To engage in a course of conduct to communicate, or to cause to be communicated, words, images, or language by or through the use of electronic mail or electronic communication, directed at a specific person; or

(9)(a)The sentencing court shall consider, as a part of any sentence, issuing an order restraining the defendant from any contact with the victim, which may be valid for up to 10 years, as determined by the court. It is the intent of the Legislature that the length of any such order be based upon the seriousness of the facts before the court, the probability of future violations by the perpetrator, and the safety of the victim and his or her family members or individuals closely associated with the victim.
(b)The order may be issued by the court even if the defendant is sentenced to a state prison or a county jail or even if the imposition of the sentence is suspended and the defendant is placed on probation.

  (initials)  

(4)Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall set a hearing to be held at the earliest possible time. The respondent shall be personally served with a copy of the petition, notice of hearing, and temporary injunction, if any, before the hearing.
(5)(a)If it appears to the court that stalking exists, the court may grant a temporary injunction ex parte, pending a full hearing, and may grant such relief as the court deems proper, including an injunction restraining the respondent from committing any act of stalking.
(b)Except as provided in s. 90.204, in a hearing ex parte for the purpose of obtaining such ex parte temporary injunction, evidence other than verified pleadings or affidavits may not be used as evidence, unless the respondent appears at the hearing or has received reasonable notice of the hearing. A denial of a petition for an ex parte injunction shall be by written order noting the legal grounds for denial. If the only ground for denial is no appearance of an immediate and present danger of stalking, the court shall set a full hearing on the petition for injunction with notice at the earliest possible time. This paragraph does not affect a petitioner’s right to promptly amend any petition, or otherwise be heard in person on any petition consistent with the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.
(c)Any such ex parte temporary injunction is effective for a fixed period not to exceed 15 days. A full hearing, as provided in this section, shall be set for a date no later than the date when the temporary injunction ceases to be effective. The court may grant a continuance of the hearing before or during a hearing for good cause shown by any party, which shall include a continuance to obtain service of process. An injunction shall be extended if necessary to remain in full force and effect during any period of continuance.
(6)(a)Upon notice and hearing, when it appears to the court that the petitioner is the victim of stalking, the court may grant such relief as the court deems proper, including an injunction:
1.Restraining the respondent from committing any act of stalking.
2.Ordering the respondent to participate in treatment, intervention, or counseling services to be paid for by the respondent.

4.Ordering such other relief as the court deems necessary for the protection of a victim of stalking, including injunctions or directives to law enforcement agencies, as provided in this section.
(b)The terms of an injunction restraining the respondent under subparagraph (a)1. or ordering other relief for the protection of the victim under subparagraph (a)4. shall remain in effect until modified or dissolved. Either party may move at any time to modify or dissolve the injunction. Specific allegations are not required. Such relief may be granted in addition to other civil or criminal remedies.
(c)A temporary or final judgment on injunction for protection against stalking entered pursuant to this section shall, on its face, indicate:
1.That the injunction is valid and enforceable in all counties of this state.
2.That law enforcement officers may use their arrest powers pursuant to s. 901.15(6) to enforce the terms of the injunction.
3.That the court has jurisdiction over the parties and matter under the laws of this state and that reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard was given to the person against whom the order is sought sufficient to protect that person’s right to due process.
4.The date that the respondent was served with the temporary or final order, if obtainable.
(d)The fact that a separate order of protection is granted to each opposing party is not legally sufficient to deny any remedy to either party or to prove that the parties are equally at fault or equally endangered.
(e)A final judgment on an injunction for protection against stalking entered pursuant to this section must, on its face, provide that it is a violation of s. 790.233 and a misdemeanor of the first degree for the respondent to have in his or her care, custody, possession, or control any firearm or ammunition.
(f)All proceedings under this subsection shall be recorded. Recording may be by electronic means as provided by the Rules of Judicial Administration.
(7)The court shall allow an advocate from a state attorney’s office, a law enforcement agency, a certified rape crisis center, or a certified domestic violence center who is registered under s. 39.905 to be present with the petitioner or respondent during any court proceedings or hearings related to the injunction for protection if the petitioner or respondent has made such a request and the advocate is able to be present.
(8)(a)1.The clerk of the court shall furnish a copy of the petition, notice of hearing, and temporary injunction, if any, to the sheriff or a law enforcement agency of the county where the respondent resides or can be found, who shall serve it upon the respondent as soon thereafter as possible on any day of the week and at any time of the day or night. When requested by the sheriff, the clerk of the court may transmit a facsimile copy of an injunction that has been certified by the clerk of the court, and this facsimile copy may be served in the same manner as a certified copy. Upon receiving a facsimile copy, the sheriff must verify receipt with the sender before attempting to serve it on the respondent. In addition, if the sheriff is in possession of an injunction for protection that has been certified by the clerk of the court, the sheriff may transmit a facsimile copy of that injunction to a law enforcement officer who shall serve it in the same manner as a certified copy. The clerk of the court shall furnish to the sheriff such information concerning the respondent’s physical description and location as is required by the Department of Law Enforcement to comply with the verification procedures set forth in this section. Notwithstanding any other law, the chief judge of each circuit, in consultation with the appropriate sheriff, may authorize a law enforcement agency within the jurisdiction to effect service. A law enforcement agency serving injunctions pursuant to this section shall use service and verification procedures consistent with those of the sheriff.
2.If an injunction is issued and the petitioner requests the assistance of a law enforcement agency, the court may order that an officer from the appropriate law enforcement agency accompany the petitioner to assist in the execution or service of the injunction. A law enforcement officer shall accept a copy of an injunction for protection against stalking, certified by the clerk of the court, from the petitioner and immediately serve it upon a respondent who has been located but not yet served.
3.An order issued, changed, continued, extended, or vacated subsequent to the original service of documents enumerated under subparagraph 1. shall be certified by the clerk of the court and delivered to the parties at the time of the entry of the order. The parties may acknowledge receipt of such order in writing on the face of the original order. If a party fails or refuses to acknowledge the receipt of a certified copy of an order, the clerk shall note on the original order that service was effected. If delivery at the hearing is not possible, the clerk shall mail certified copies of the order to the parties at the last known address of each party. Service by mail is complete upon mailing. When an order is served pursuant to this subsection, the clerk shall prepare a written certification to be placed in the court file specifying the time, date, and method of service and shall notify the sheriff.
4.If the respondent has been served previously with a temporary injunction and has failed to appear at the initial hearing on the temporary injunction, any subsequent petition for injunction seeking an extension of time may be served on the respondent by the clerk of the court by certified mail in lieu of personal service by a law enforcement officer.
(b)1.Within 24 hours after the court issues an injunction for protection against stalking or changes, continues, extends, or vacates an injunction for protection against stalking, the clerk of the court must forward a certified copy of the injunction for service to the sheriff having jurisdiction over the residence of the petitioner. The injunction must be served in accordance with this subsection.
2.Within 24 hours after service of process of an injunction for protection against stalking upon a respondent, the law enforcement officer must forward the written proof of service of process to the sheriff having jurisdiction over the residence of the petitioner.
3.Within 24 hours after the sheriff receives a certified copy of the injunction for protection against stalking, the sheriff must make information relating to the injunction available to other law enforcement agencies by electronically transmitting such information to the Department of Law Enforcement.
4.Within 24 hours after the sheriff or other law enforcement officer has made service upon the respondent and the sheriff has been so notified, the sheriff must make information relating to the service available to other law enforcement agencies by electronically transmitting such information to the Department of Law Enforcement.
5.Within 24 hours after an injunction for protection against stalking is vacated, terminated, or otherwise rendered no longer effective by ruling of the court, the clerk of the court must notify the sheriff receiving original notification of the injunction as provided in subparagraph 2. That agency shall, within 24 hours after receiving such notification from the clerk of the court, notify the Department of Law Enforcement of such action of the court.
(9)(a)The court may enforce a violation of an injunction for protection against stalking through a civil or criminal contempt proceeding, or the state attorney may prosecute it as a criminal violation under s. 784.0487. Any assessments or fines ordered by the court enforcing such an injunction shall be collected by the clerk of the court and transferred on a monthly basis to the State Treasury for deposit into the Domestic Violence Trust Fund.
(b)If the respondent is arrested by a law enforcement officer under s. 901.15(6) or for a violation of s. 784.0487, the respondent shall be held in custody until brought before the court as expeditiously as possible for the purpose of enforcing the injunction and for admittance to bail in accordance with chapter 903 and the applicable rules of criminal procedure, pending a hearing.
(10)The petitioner or the respondent may move the court to modify or dissolve an injunction at any time.

784.0487Violation of an injunction for protection against stalking or cyberstalking.—
(1)If the injunction for protection against stalking or cyberstalking has been violated and the respondent has not been arrested, the petitioner may contact the clerk of the circuit court of the county in which the violation is alleged to have occurred. The clerk shall assist the petitioner in preparing an affidavit in support of reporting the violation or directing the petitioner to the office operated by the court that has been designated by the chief judge of that circuit as the central intake point for violations of injunctions for protection where the petitioner can receive assistance in the preparation of the affidavit in support of the violation.
(2)The affidavit shall be immediately forwarded by the office assisting the petitioner to the state attorney of that circuit and to such judge as the chief judge determines to be the recipient of affidavits of violations of an injunction. If the affidavit alleges that a crime has been committed, the office assisting the petitioner shall also forward a copy of the petitioner’s affidavit to the appropriate law enforcement agency for investigation. No later than 20 days after receiving the initial report, the local law enforcement agency shall complete its investigation and forward a report to the state attorney. The policy adopted by the state attorney in each circuit under s. 741.2901(2) shall include a policy regarding intake of alleged violations of injunctions for protection against stalking or cyberstalking under this section. The intake shall be supervised by a state attorney who has been designated and assigned to handle stalking or cyberstalking cases. The state attorney shall determine within 30 working days whether his or her office will file criminal charges or prepare a motion for an order to show cause as to why the respondent should not be held in criminal contempt, or prepare both as alternative findings, or file notice that the case remains under investigation or is pending subject to some other action.
(3)If the court has knowledge that the petitioner or another person is in immediate danger if the court does not act before the decision of the state attorney to proceed, the court shall immediately issue an order of appointment of the state attorney to file a motion for an order to show cause as to why the respondent should not be held in contempt. If the court does not issue an order of appointment of the state attorney, it shall immediately notify the state attorney that the court is proceeding to enforce the violation through criminal contempt.

For purposes of this paragraph, the term “conviction” means a determination of guilt that is the result of a plea or a trial, regardless of whether adjudication is withheld or a plea of nolo contendere is entered.
(5)A person who suffers an injury or loss as a result of a violation of an injunction for protection against stalking or cyberstalking may be awarded economic damages for that injury or loss by the court issuing the injunction. Damages include costs and attorney fees for enforcement of the injunction.

784.049Sexual cyberharassment.—
(1)The Legislature finds that:
(a)A person depicted in a sexually explicit image taken with the person’s consent may retain a reasonable expectation that the image will remain private despite sharing the image with another person, such as an intimate partner.

787.06Human trafficking.—
(1)(a)The Legislature finds that human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery. Victims of human trafficking are young children, teenagers, and adults. Thousands of victims are trafficked annually across international borders worldwide. Many of these victims are trafficked into this state. Victims of human trafficking also include citizens of the United States and those persons trafficked domestically within the borders of the United States. The Legislature finds that victims of human trafficking are subjected to force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of sexual exploitation or forced labor.
(b)The Legislature finds that while many victims of human trafficking are forced to work in prostitution or the sexual entertainment industry, trafficking also occurs in forms of labor exploitation, such as domestic servitude, restaurant work, janitorial work, sweatshop factory work, and migrant agricultural work.
(c)The Legislature finds that traffickers use various techniques to instill fear in victims and to keep them enslaved. Some traffickers keep their victims under lock and key. However, the most frequently used practices are less obvious techniques that include isolating victims from the public and family members; confiscating passports, visas, or other identification documents; using or threatening to use violence toward victims or their families; telling victims that they will be imprisoned or deported for immigration violations if they contact authorities; and controlling the victims’ funds by holding the money ostensibly for safekeeping.
(d)It is the intent of the Legislature that the perpetrators of human trafficking be penalized for their illegal conduct and that the victims of trafficking be protected and assisted by this state and its agencies. In furtherance of this policy, it is the intent of the Legislature that the state Supreme Court, The Florida Bar, and relevant state agencies prepare and implement training programs in order that judges, attorneys, law enforcement personnel, investigators, and others are able to identify traffickers and victims of human trafficking and direct victims to appropriate agencies for assistance. It is the intent of the Legislature that the Department of Children and Families and other state agencies cooperate with other state and federal agencies to ensure that victims of human trafficking can access social services and benefits to alleviate their plight.

(d)Is found guilty of a crime under the provisions of chapter 893, or similar laws of any other state, relating to controlled substances;
(e)Is committed as a substance abuser under chapter 397, or is deemed a habitual offender under s. 856.011(3), or similar laws of any other state;
(f)Is convicted of a second violation of s. 316.193, or a similar law of another state, within 3 years after a first conviction of such section or similar law of another state, even though the first violation may have occurred before the date on which the application was submitted;
(g)Is adjudicated an incapacitated person under s. 744.331, or similar laws of any other state; or
(h)Is committed to a mental institution under chapter 394, or similar laws of any other state.
Notwithstanding s. 120.60(5), service of a notice of the suspension or revocation of a concealed weapon or firearm license must be given by either certified mail, return receipt requested, to the licensee at his or her last known mailing address furnished to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, or by personal service. If a notice given by certified mail is returned as undeliverable, a second attempt must be made to provide notice to the licensee at that address, by either first-class mail in an envelope, postage prepaid, addressed to the licensee at his or her last known mailing address furnished to the department, or, if the licensee has provided an e-mail address to the department, by e-mail. Such mailing by the department constitutes notice, and any failure by the licensee to receive such notice does not stay the effective date or term of the suspension or revocation. A request for hearing must be filed with the department within 21 days after notice is received by personal delivery, or within 26 days after the date the department deposits the notice in the United States mail (21 days plus 5 days for mailing). The department shall document its attempts to provide notice, and such documentation is admissible in the courts of this state and constitutes sufficient proof that notice was given.

(11)(a)At least 90 days before the expiration date of the license, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services shall mail to each licensee a written notice of the expiration and a renewal form prescribed by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The licensee must renew his or her license on or before the expiration date by filing with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services the renewal form containing an affidavit submitted under oath and under penalty of perjury stating that the licensee remains qualified pursuant to the criteria specified in subsections (2) and (3), a color photograph as specified in paragraph (5)(e), and the required renewal fee. Out-of-state residents must also submit a complete set of fingerprints and fingerprint processing fee. The license shall be renewed upon receipt of the completed renewal form, color photograph, appropriate payment of fees, and, if applicable, fingerprints. Additionally, a licensee who fails to file a renewal application on or before its expiration date must renew his or her license by paying a late fee of $15. A license may not be renewed 180 days or more after its expiration date, and such a license is deemed to be permanently expired. A person whose license has been permanently expired may reapply for licensure; however, an application for licensure and fees under subsection (5) must be submitted, and a background investigation shall be conducted pursuant to this section. A person who knowingly files false information under this subsection is subject to criminal prosecution under s. 837.06.
(b)A license issued to a servicemember, as defined in s. 250.01, is subject to paragraph (a); however, such a license does not expire while the servicemember is serving on military orders that have taken him or her over 35 miles from his or her residence and shall be extended, as provided in this paragraph, for up to 180 days after his or her return to such residence. If the license renewal requirements in paragraph (a) are met within the 180-day extension period, the servicemember may not be charged any additional costs, such as, but not limited to, late fees or delinquency fees, above the normal license fees. The servicemember must present to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services a copy of his or her official military orders or a written verification from the member’s commanding officer before the end of the 180-day period in order to qualify for the extension.
(12)(a)A license issued under this section does not authorize any person to openly carry a handgun or carry a concealed weapon or firearm into:
1.Any place of nuisance as defined in s. 823.05;
2.Any police, sheriff, or highway patrol station;
3.Any detention facility, prison, or jail;
4.Any courthouse;
5.Any courtroom, except that nothing in this section would preclude a judge from carrying a concealed weapon or determining who will carry a concealed weapon in his or her courtroom;
6.Any polling place;
7.Any meeting of the governing body of a county, public school district, municipality, or special district;
8.Any meeting of the Legislature or a committee thereof;
9.Any school, college, or professional athletic event not related to firearms;
10.Any elementary or secondary school facility or administration building;
11.Any career center;
12.Any portion of an establishment licensed to dispense alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises, which portion of the establishment is primarily devoted to such purpose;
13.Any college or university facility unless the licensee is a registered student, employee, or faculty member of such college or university and the weapon is a stun gun or nonlethal electric weapon or device designed solely for defensive purposes and the weapon does not fire a dart or projectile;
14.The inside of the passenger terminal and sterile area of any airport, provided that no person shall be prohibited from carrying any legal firearm into the terminal, which firearm is encased for shipment for purposes of checking such firearm as baggage to be lawfully transported on any aircraft; or
15.Any place where the carrying of firearms is prohibited by federal law.
(b)A person licensed under this section shall not be prohibited from carrying or storing a firearm in a vehicle for lawful purposes.
(c)This section does not modify the terms or conditions of s. 790.251(7).
(d)Any person who knowingly and willfully violates any provision of this subsection commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.
(13)All moneys collected by the department pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the Division of Licensing Trust Fund, and the Legislature shall appropriate from the fund those amounts deemed necessary to administer the provisions of this section. All revenues collected, less those costs determined by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to be nonrecurring or one-time costs, shall be deferred over the 7-year licensure period. Notwithstanding the provisions of s. 493.6117, all moneys collected pursuant to this section shall not revert to the General Revenue Fund; however, this shall not abrogate the requirement for payment of the service charge imposed pursuant to chapter 215.
(14)All funds received by the sheriff pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be deposited into the general revenue fund of the county and shall be budgeted to the sheriff.
(15)The Legislature finds as a matter of public policy and fact that it is necessary to provide statewide uniform standards for issuing licenses to carry concealed weapons and firearms for self-defense and finds it necessary to occupy the field of regulation of the bearing of concealed weapons or firearms for self-defense to ensure that no honest, law-abiding person who qualifies under the provisions of this section is subjectively or arbitrarily denied his or her rights. The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services shall implement and administer the provisions of this section. The Legislature does not delegate to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services the authority to regulate or restrict the issuing of licenses provided for in this section, beyond those provisions contained in this section. Subjective or arbitrary actions or rules which encumber the issuing process by placing burdens on the applicant beyond those sworn statements and specified documents detailed in this section or which create restrictions beyond those specified in this section are in conflict with the intent of this section and are prohibited. This section shall be liberally construed to carry out the constitutional right to bear arms for self-defense. This section is supplemental and additional to existing rights to bear arms, and nothing in this section shall impair or diminish such rights.
(16)The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services shall maintain statistical information on the number of licenses issued, revoked, suspended, and denied.
(17)As amended by chapter 87-24, Laws of Florida, this section shall be known and may be cited as the “Jack Hagler Self Defense Act.”

1790.065Sale and delivery of firearms.—
(1)(a)A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer may not sell or deliver from her or his inventory at her or his licensed premises any firearm to another person, other than a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector, until she or he has:
1.Obtained a completed form from the potential buyer or transferee, which form shall have been promulgated by the Department of Law Enforcement and provided by the licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer, which shall include the name, date of birth, gender, race, and social security number or other identification number of such potential buyer or transferee and has inspected proper identification including an identification containing a photograph of the potential buyer or transferee.
22.Collected a fee from the potential buyer for processing the criminal history check of the potential buyer. The fee shall be established by the Department of Law Enforcement and may not exceed $8 per transaction. The Department of Law Enforcement may reduce, or suspend collection of, the fee to reflect payment received from the Federal Government applied to the cost of maintaining the criminal history check system established by this section as a means of facilitating or supplementing the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The Department of Law Enforcement shall, by rule, establish procedures for the fees to be transmitted by the licensee to the Department of Law Enforcement. Such procedures must provide that fees may be paid or transmitted by electronic means, including, but not limited to, debit cards, credit cards, or electronic funds transfers. All such fees shall be deposited into the Department of Law Enforcement Operating Trust Fund, but shall be segregated from all other funds deposited into such trust fund and must be accounted for separately. Such segregated funds must not be used for any purpose other than the operation of the criminal history checks required by this section. The Department of Law Enforcement, each year before February 1, shall make a full accounting of all receipts and expenditures of such funds to the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the majority and minority leaders of each house of the Legislature, and the chairs of the appropriations committees of each house of the Legislature. In the event that the cumulative amount of funds collected exceeds the cumulative amount of expenditures by more than $2.5 million, excess funds may be used for the purpose of purchasing soft body armor for law enforcement officers.
3.Requested, by means of a toll-free telephone call or other electronic means, the Department of Law Enforcement to conduct a check of the information as reported and reflected in the Florida Crime Information Center and National Crime Information Center systems as of the date of the request.
4.Received a unique approval number for that inquiry from the Department of Law Enforcement, and recorded the date and such number on the consent form.
(b)However, if the person purchasing, or receiving delivery of, the firearm is a holder of a valid concealed weapons or firearms license pursuant to the provisions of s. 790.06 or holds an active certification from the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission as a “law enforcement officer,” a “correctional officer,” or a “correctional probation officer” as defined in s. 943.10(1), (2), (3), (6), (7), (8), or (9), this subsection does not apply.
(c)This subsection does not apply to the purchase, trade, or transfer of a rifle or shotgun by a resident of this state when the resident makes such purchase, trade, or transfer from a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer in another state.
(2)Upon receipt of a request for a criminal history record check, the Department of Law Enforcement shall, during the licensee’s call or by return call, forthwith:
(a)Review any records available to determine if the potential buyer or transferee:
1.Has been convicted of a felony and is prohibited from receipt or possession of a firearm pursuant to s. 790.23;
2.Has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, and therefore is prohibited from purchasing a firearm;
3.Has had adjudication of guilt withheld or imposition of sentence suspended on any felony or misdemeanor crime of domestic violence unless 3 years have elapsed since probation or any other conditions set by the court have been fulfilled or expunction has occurred; or
4.Has been adjudicated mentally defective or has been committed to a mental institution by a court or as provided in sub-sub-subparagraph b.(II), and as a result is prohibited by state or federal law from purchasing a firearm.
a.As used in this subparagraph, “adjudicated mentally defective” means a determination by a court that a person, as a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease, is a danger to himself or herself or to others or lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his or her own affairs. The phrase includes a judicial finding of incapacity under s. 744.331(6)(a), an acquittal by reason of insanity of a person charged with a criminal offense, and a judicial finding that a criminal defendant is not competent to stand trial.
b.As used in this subparagraph, “committed to a mental institution” means:
(I)Involuntary commitment, commitment for mental defectiveness or mental illness, and commitment for substance abuse. The phrase includes involuntary inpatient placement as defined in s. 394.467, involuntary outpatient placement as defined in s. 394.4655, involuntary assessment and stabilization under s. 397.6818, and involuntary substance abuse treatment under s. 397.6957, but does not include a person in a mental institution for observation or discharged from a mental institution based upon the initial review by the physician or a voluntary admission to a mental institution; or
(II)Notwithstanding sub-sub-subparagraph (I), voluntary admission to a mental institution for outpatient or inpatient treatment of a person who had an involuntary examination under s. 394.463, where each of the following conditions have been met:
(A)An examining physician found that the person is an imminent danger to himself or herself or others.
(B)The examining physician certified that if the person did not agree to voluntary treatment, a petition for involuntary outpatient or inpatient treatment would have been filed under s. 394.463(2)(g)4., or the examining physician certified that a petition was filed and the person subsequently agreed to voluntary treatment prior to a court hearing on the petition.
(C)Before agreeing to voluntary treatment, the person received written notice of that finding and certification, and written notice that as a result of such finding, he or she may be prohibited from purchasing a firearm, and may not be eligible to apply for or retain a concealed weapon or firearms license under s. 790.06 and the person acknowledged such notice in writing, in substantially the following form:
“I understand that the doctor who examined me believes I am a danger to myself or to others. I understand that if I do not agree to voluntary treatment, a petition will be filed in court to require me to receive involuntary treatment. I understand that if that petition is filed, I have the right to contest it. In the event a petition has been filed, I understand that I can subsequently agree to voluntary treatment prior to a court hearing. I understand that by agreeing to voluntary treatment in either of these situations, I may be prohibited from buying firearms and from applying for or retaining a concealed weapons or firearms license until I apply for and receive relief from that restriction under Florida law.”

(D)A judge or a magistrate has, pursuant to sub-sub-subparagraph c.(II), reviewed the record of the finding, certification, notice, and written acknowledgment classifying the person as an imminent danger to himself or herself or others, and ordered that such record be submitted to the department.
c.In order to check for these conditions, the department shall compile and maintain an automated database of persons who are prohibited from purchasing a firearm based on court records of adjudications of mental defectiveness or commitments to mental institutions.
(I)Except as provided in sub-sub-subparagraph (II), clerks of court shall submit these records to the department within 1 month after the rendition of the adjudication or commitment. Reports shall be submitted in an automated format. The reports must, at a minimum, include the name, along with any known alias or former name, the sex, and the date of birth of the subject.
(II)For persons committed to a mental institution pursuant to sub-sub-subparagraph b.(II), within 24 hours after the person’s agreement to voluntary admission, a record of the finding, certification, notice, and written acknowledgment must be filed by the administrator of the receiving or treatment facility, as defined in s. 394.455, with the clerk of the court for the county in which the involuntary examination under s. 394.463 occurred. No fee shall be charged for the filing under this sub-sub-subparagraph. The clerk must present the records to a judge or magistrate within 24 hours after receipt of the records. A judge or magistrate is required and has the lawful authority to review the records ex parte and, if the judge or magistrate determines that the record supports the classifying of the person as an imminent danger to himself or herself or others, to order that the record be submitted to the department. If a judge or magistrate orders the submittal of the record to the department, the record must be submitted to the department within 24 hours.
d.A person who has been adjudicated mentally defective or committed to a mental institution, as those terms are defined in this paragraph, may petition the court that made the adjudication or commitment, or the court that ordered that the record be submitted to the department pursuant to sub-sub-subparagraph c.(II), for relief from the firearm disabilities imposed by such adjudication or commitment. A copy of the petition shall be served on the state attorney for the county in which the person was adjudicated or committed. The state attorney may object to and present evidence relevant to the relief sought by the petition. The hearing on the petition may be open or closed as the petitioner may choose. The petitioner may present evidence and subpoena witnesses to appear at the hearing on the petition. The petitioner may confront and cross-examine witnesses called by the state attorney. A record of the hearing shall be made by a certified court reporter or by court-approved electronic means. The court shall make written findings of fact and conclusions of law on the issues before it and issue a final order. The court shall grant the relief requested in the petition if the court finds, based on the evidence presented with respect to the petitioner’s reputation, the petitioner’s mental health record and, if applicable, criminal history record, the circumstances surrounding the firearm disability, and any other evidence in the record, that the petitioner will not be likely to act in a manner that is dangerous to public safety and that granting the relief would not be contrary to the public interest. If the final order denies relief, the petitioner may not petition again for relief from firearm disabilities until 1 year after the date of the final order. The petitioner may seek judicial review of a final order denying relief in the district court of appeal having jurisdiction over the court that issued the order. The review shall be conducted de novo. Relief from a firearm disability granted under this sub-subparagraph has no effect on the loss of civil rights, including firearm rights, for any reason other than the particular adjudication of mental defectiveness or commitment to a mental institution from which relief is granted.
e.Upon receipt of proper notice of relief from firearm disabilities granted under sub-subparagraph d., the department shall delete any mental health record of the person granted relief from the automated database of persons who are prohibited from purchasing a firearm based on court records of adjudications of mental defectiveness or commitments to mental institutions.
f.The department is authorized to disclose data collected pursuant to this subparagraph to agencies of the Federal Government and other states for use exclusively in determining the lawfulness of a firearm sale or transfer. The department is also authorized to disclose this data to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services for purposes of determining eligibility for issuance of a concealed weapons or concealed firearms license and for determining whether a basis exists for revoking or suspending a previously issued license pursuant to s. 790.06(10). When a potential buyer or transferee appeals a nonapproval based on these records, the clerks of court and mental institutions shall, upon request by the department, provide information to help determine whether the potential buyer or transferee is the same person as the subject of the record. Photographs and any other data that could confirm or negate identity must be made available to the department for such purposes, notwithstanding any other provision of state law to the contrary. Any such information that is made confidential or exempt from disclosure by law shall retain such confidential or exempt status when transferred to the department.
(b)Inform the licensee making the inquiry either that records demonstrate that the buyer or transferee is so prohibited and provide the licensee a nonapproval number, or provide the licensee with a unique approval number.
(c)1.Review any records available to it to determine whether the potential buyer or transferee has been indicted or has had an information filed against her or him for an offense that is a felony under either state or federal law, or, as mandated by federal law, has had an injunction for protection against domestic violence entered against the potential buyer or transferee under s. 741.30, has had an injunction for protection against repeat violence entered against the potential buyer or transferee under s. 784.046, or has been arrested for a dangerous crime as specified in s. 907.041(4)(a) or for any of the following enumerated offenses:
a.Criminal anarchy under ss. 876.01 and 876.02.
b.Extortion under s. 836.05.
c.Explosives violations under s. 552.22(1) and (2).
d.Controlled substances violations under chapter 893.
e.Resisting an officer with violence under s. 843.01.
f.Weapons and firearms violations under this chapter.
g.Treason under s. 876.32.
h.Assisting self-murder under s. 782.08.
i.Sabotage under s. 876.38.
j.Stalking or aggravated stalking under s. 784.048.
If the review indicates any such indictment, information, or arrest, the department shall provide to the licensee a conditional nonapproval number.

2.Within 24 working hours, the department shall determine the disposition of the indictment, information, or arrest and inform the licensee as to whether the potential buyer is prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm. For purposes of this paragraph, “working hours” means the hours from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays.
3.The office of the clerk of court, at no charge to the department, shall respond to any department request for data on the disposition of the indictment, information, or arrest as soon as possible, but in no event later than 8 working hours.
4.The department shall determine as quickly as possible within the allotted time period whether the potential buyer is prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm.
5.If the potential buyer is not so prohibited, or if the department cannot determine the disposition information within the allotted time period, the department shall provide the licensee with a conditional approval number.
6.If the buyer is so prohibited, the conditional nonapproval number shall become a nonapproval number.

(1)(a)Any person who uses a firearm within this state shall submit to an approved chemical or physical breath test to determine the alcoholic content of the blood and to a urine test to detect the presence of controlled substances, if there is probable cause to believe that the person was using a firearm while under the influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances or that the person is lawfully arrested for any offense allegedly committed while he or she was using a firearm while under the influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances. The breath test shall be incidental to a lawful arrest and administered at the request of a law enforcement officer who has probable cause to believe such person was using the firearm within this state while under the influence of alcoholic beverages. The urine test shall be incidental to a lawful arrest and administered at a detention facility, mobile or otherwise, which is equipped to administer such tests at the request of a law enforcement officer who has probable cause to believe such person was using a firearm within this state while under the influence of controlled substances. The urine test shall be administered at a detention facility or any other facility, mobile or otherwise, which is equipped to administer such tests in a reasonable manner that will ensure the accuracy of the specimen and maintain the privacy of the individual involved. The administration of either test shall not preclude the administration of the other test. The refusal to submit to a chemical or physical breath or urine test upon the request of a law enforcement officer as provided in this section shall be admissible into evidence in any criminal proceeding. This section shall not hinder the taking of a mandatory blood test as outlined in s. 790.155.
(b)If the arresting officer does not request a chemical or physical test of the person arrested for any offense allegedly committed while the person was using a firearm while under the influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances, such person may request the arresting officer to have a chemical or physical test made of the arrested person’s breath for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of the person’s blood or a chemical test of urine or blood for the purpose of determining the presence of controlled substances; and, if so requested, the arresting officer shall have the test performed.
(c)The provisions of s. 316.1932(1)(f), relating to administration of tests for determining the weight of alcohol in the defendant’s blood, additional tests at the defendant’s expense, availability of test information to the defendant or the defendant’s attorney, and liability of medical institutions and persons administering such tests are incorporated into this act.
(2)The results of any test administered pursuant to this section for the purpose of detecting the presence of any controlled substance shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal prosecution for the possession of a controlled substance.
(3)Notwithstanding any provision of law pertaining to the confidentiality of hospital records or other medical records, information obtained pursuant to this section shall be released to a court, prosecuting attorney, defense attorney, or law enforcement officer in connection with an alleged violation of s. 790.151 upon request for such information.

The law enforcement officer may use reasonable force if necessary to require such person to submit to the administration of the blood test. The blood test shall be performed in a reasonable manner.
(b)The term “serious bodily injury” means a physical condition which creates a substantial risk of death, serious personal disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.
(2)The provisions of s. 316.1933(2), relating to blood tests for impairment or intoxication, are incorporated into this act.
(3)(a)Any criminal charge resulting from the incident giving rise to the officer’s demand for testing should be tried concurrently with a charge of any violation of s. 790.151. If such charges are tried separately, the fact that such person refused, resisted, obstructed, or opposed testing shall be admissible at the trial of the criminal offense which gave rise to the demand for testing.
(b)The results of any test administered pursuant to this section for the purpose of detecting the presence of any controlled substance shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal prosecution for the possession of a controlled substance.
(4)Notwithstanding any provision of law pertaining to the confidentiality of hospital records or other medical records, information obtained pursuant to this section shall be released to a court, prosecuting attorney, defense attorney, or law enforcement officer in connection with an alleged violation of s. 790.151 upon request for such information.

(1)It is unlawful and punishable as provided in s. 790.151 for any person who is under the influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances, when affected to the extent that his or her normal faculties are impaired, to use a firearm in this state.
(2)Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while using a firearm while under the influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances, when affected to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired or to the extent that the person was deprived of full possession of his or her normal faculties, the results of any test administered in accordance with s. 790.153 or s. 790.155 and this section shall be admissible into evidence when otherwise admissible, and the amount of alcohol in the person’s blood at the time alleged, as shown by chemical analysis of the person’s blood or chemical or physical analysis of the person’s breath, shall give rise to the following presumptions:
(a)If there was at that time 0.05 percent or less by weight of alcohol in the person’s blood, it shall be presumed that the person was not under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired.
(b)If there was at that time in excess of 0.05 percent but less than 0.10 percent by weight of alcohol in the person’s blood, such fact shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired, but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired.
(c)If there was at that time 0.10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in the person’s blood, that fact shall be prima facie evidence that the person was under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired.
The percent by weight of alcohol in the blood shall be based upon grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. The foregoing provisions of this subsection shall not be construed as limiting the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether the person was under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired.

(3)A chemical analysis of a person’s blood to determine its alcoholic content or a chemical or physical analysis of a person’s breath, in order to be considered valid under the provisions of this section, must have been performed substantially in accordance with methods approved by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the department for this purpose. Any insubstantial differences between approved techniques and actual testing procedures in an individual case shall not render the test or test results invalid. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement may approve satisfactory techniques or methods, ascertain the qualification and competence of individuals to conduct such analyses, and issue permits which shall be subject to termination or revocation in accordance with rules adopted by the department.
(4)Any person charged with using a firearm while under the influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired, whether in a municipality or not, shall be entitled to trial by jury according to the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure.

As used in this section, the term “firearm” includes ammunition and accoutrements attendant to the lawful possession and use of a firearm.

(3)LEGISLATIVE INTENT; FINDINGS.—This act is intended to codify the long-standing legislative policy of the state that individual citizens have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms, that they have a constitutional right to possess and keep legally owned firearms within their motor vehicles for self-defense and other lawful purposes, and that these rights are not abrogated by virtue of a citizen becoming a customer, employee, or invitee of a business entity. It is the finding of the Legislature that a citizen’s lawful possession, transportation, and secure keeping of firearms and ammunition within his or her motor vehicle is essential to the exercise of the fundamental constitutional right to keep and bear arms and the constitutional right of self-defense. The Legislature finds that protecting and preserving these rights is essential to the exercise of freedom and individual responsibility. The Legislature further finds that no citizen can or should be required to waive or abrogate his or her right to possess and securely keep firearms and ammunition locked within his or her motor vehicle by virtue of becoming a customer, employee, or invitee of any employer or business establishment within the state, unless specifically required by state or federal law.
(4)PROHIBITED ACTS.—No public or private employer may violate the constitutional rights of any customer, employee, or invitee as provided in paragraphs (a)-(e):

Further, no public or private employer may take any action against a customer, employee, or invitee based upon verbal or written statements of any party concerning possession of a firearm stored inside a private motor vehicle in a parking lot for lawful purposes. A search of a private motor vehicle in the parking lot of a public or private employer to ascertain the presence of a firearm within the vehicle may only be conducted by on-duty law enforcement personnel, based upon due process and must comply with constitutional protections.
(c)No public or private employer shall condition employment upon either:
1.The fact that an employee or prospective employee holds or does not hold a license issued pursuant to s. 790.06; or
2.Any agreement by an employee or a prospective employee that prohibits an employee from keeping a legal firearm locked inside or locked to a private motor vehicle in a parking lot when such firearm is kept for lawful purposes.
(d)No public or private employer shall prohibit or attempt to prevent any customer, employee, or invitee from entering the parking lot of the employer’s place of business because the customer’s, employee’s, or invitee’s private motor vehicle contains a legal firearm being carried for lawful purposes, that is out of sight within the customer’s, employee’s, or invitee’s private motor vehicle.
(e)No public or private employer may terminate the employment of or otherwise discriminate against an employee, or expel a customer or invitee for exercising his or her constitutional right to keep and bear arms or for exercising the right of self-defense as long as a firearm is never exhibited on company property for any reason other than lawful defensive purposes.

(a)When subject to the provisions of subsection (4), a public or private employer has no duty of care related to the actions prohibited under such subsection.

(c)Nothing contained in this section shall be interpreted to expand any existing duty, or create any additional duty, on the part of a public or private employer, property owner, or property owner’s agent.
(6)ENFORCEMENT.—The Attorney General shall enforce the protections of this act on behalf of any customer, employee, or invitee aggrieved under this act. If there is reasonable cause to believe that the aggrieved person’s rights under this act have been violated by a public or private employer, the Attorney General shall commence a civil or administrative action for damages, injunctive relief and civil penalties, and such other relief as may be appropriate under the provisions of s. 760.51, or may negotiate a settlement with any employer on behalf of any person aggrieved under the act. However, nothing in this act shall prohibit the right of a person aggrieved under this act to bring a civil action for violation of rights protected under the act. In any successful action brought by a customer, employee, or invitee aggrieved under this act, the court shall award all reasonable personal costs and losses suffered by the aggrieved person as a result of the violation of rights under this act.

790.331Prohibition of civil actions against firearms or ammunition manufacturers, firearms trade associations, firearms or ammunition distributors, or firearms or ammunition dealers.—
(1)The Legislature finds and declares that the manufacture, distribution, or sale of firearms and ammunition by manufacturers, distributors, or dealers duly licensed by the appropriate federal and state authorities is a lawful activity and is not unreasonably dangerous, and further finds that the unlawful use of firearms and ammunition, rather than their lawful manufacture, distribution, or sale, is the proximate cause of injuries arising from their unlawful use.
(2)Except as permitted by this section, a legal action against a firearms or ammunition manufacturer, firearms trade association, firearms or ammunition distributor, or firearms or ammunition dealer on behalf of the state or its agencies and instrumentalities, or on behalf of a county, municipality, special district, or any other political subdivision or agency of the state, for damages, abatement, or injunctive relief resulting from or arising out of the lawful design, marketing, distribution, or sale of firearms or ammunition to the public is prohibited.

790.333Sport shooting and training range protection; liability; claims, expenses, and fees; penalties; preemption; construction.—
(1)LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.—
(a)The Legislature finds that in excess of 400 sport shooting and training ranges exist on public and private lands throughout this state.
(b)These sport shooting and training ranges are widely used and enjoyed by the residents of this state and are a necessary component of the guarantees of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and of s. 8, Art. I of the State Constitution.
(c)Many of these ranges are used by state and local law enforcement agencies for training, practice, and regular mandatory qualification by law enforcement officers; by Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission hunter safety instructors who teach adults and youngsters in the safe use and handling of firearms in preparation for obtaining hunting licenses; by school boards, colleges, and universities for reserve officer training corps training and activities; by school shooting teams; by Olympic competitors; and by certified instructors who teach the safe use and handling of firearms in preparation for applying for licenses to carry concealed firearms for lawful self-protection.
(d)The public policy of the State of Florida is to encourage the safe handling and operation of firearms and mandates appropriate training in the safe use and handling of firearms for persons licensed to carry concealed firearms and for persons licensed to hunt in the state. Sport shooting and training ranges throughout this state provide the location at which this important public purpose is served and at which the firearms training mandates are fulfilled.
(e)Projectiles are integral to sport shooting and training range activity and to the ownership and use of firearms.
(f)Over years of operation, projectiles have accumulated in the environment at many ranges. Whether this projectile accumulation has caused or will cause degradation of the environment or harm to human health depends on factors that are site-specific. Therefore, sport shooting and training ranges must be allowed flexibility to apply appropriate environmental management practices at ranges. The use of environmental management practices can be implemented to avoid or reduce any potential for adverse environmental impact.
(g)The Department of Environmental Protection, in collaboration with shooting range owners and operators, sport shooting organizations, law enforcement representatives, and university researchers, has developed shooting range best management practices in order to minimize any potential for any adverse environmental impact resulting from the operation of shooting ranges.
(h)Appropriate environmental management practices, when implemented where applicable, can minimize or eliminate environmental impacts associated with projectiles. Environmental management practices to maintain or to improve the condition of ranges is evolving and will continue to evolve.
(i)Unnecessary litigation and unnecessary regulation by governmental agencies of sport shooting and training ranges impairs the ability of residents of this state to ensure safe handling of firearms and to enjoy the recreational opportunities ranges provide. The cost of defending these actions is prohibitive and threatens to bankrupt and destroy the sport shooting and training range industry.
(j)The Department of Environmental Protection does not have nor has it ever had authority to force permitting requirements of part IV of chapter 403 on owners and operators of sport shooting and training ranges.
(k)The elimination of sport shooting ranges will unnecessarily impair the ability of residents of this state to exercise and practice their constitutional guarantees under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and under s. 8, Art. I of the State Constitution.
(2)LEGISLATIVE INTENT.—The Legislature intends to protect public and private sport shooting or training range owners, operators, users, employees, agents, contractors, customers, lenders, and insurers from lawsuits and other legal actions by the state, special purpose districts, or political subdivisions and to promote maximum flexibility for implementation of environmental management practices and of the principles of risk-based corrective action pursuant to s. 376.30701. It is also the intent of the Legislature that legal action against sport shooting and training ranges will only be a last-resort option and be available only to the department and only after all reasonable efforts to resolve disputes at shooting ranges, including compliance assistance, negotiations, and alternative dispute resolution, have been attempted.

790.335Prohibition of registration of firearms; electronic records.—
(1)LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT.—
(a)The Legislature finds and declares that:
1.The right of individuals to keep and bear arms is guaranteed under both the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and s. 8, Art. I of the State Constitution.
2.A list, record, or registry of legally owned firearms or law-abiding firearm owners is not a law enforcement tool and can become an instrument for profiling, harassing, or abusing law-abiding citizens based on their choice to own a firearm and exercise their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed under the United States Constitution. Further, such a list, record, or registry has the potential to fall into the wrong hands and become a shopping list for thieves.
3.A list, record, or registry of legally owned firearms or law-abiding firearm owners is not a tool for fighting terrorism, but rather is an instrument that can be used as a means to profile innocent citizens and to harass and abuse American citizens based solely on their choice to own firearms and exercise their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed under the United States Constitution.
4.Law-abiding firearm owners whose names have been illegally recorded in a list, record, or registry are entitled to redress.
(b)The Legislature intends through the provisions of this section to:
1.Protect the right of individuals to keep and bear arms as guaranteed under both the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and s. 8, Art. I of the State Constitution.
2.Protect the privacy rights of law-abiding firearm owners.
(2)PROHIBITIONS.—No state governmental agency or local government, special district, or other political subdivision or official, agent, or employee of such state or other governmental entity or any other person, public or private, shall knowingly and willfully keep or cause to be kept any list, record, or registry of privately owned firearms or any list, record, or registry of the owners of those firearms.
(3)EXCEPTIONS.—The provisions of this section shall not apply to:
(a)Records of firearms that have been used in committing any crime.
(b)Records relating to any person who has been convicted of a crime.
(c)Records of firearms that have been reported stolen that are retained for a period not in excess of 10 days after such firearms are recovered. Official documentation recording the theft of a recovered weapon may be maintained no longer than the balance of the year entered, plus 2 years.
(d)Firearm records that must be retained by firearm dealers under federal law, including copies of such records transmitted to law enforcement agencies. However, no state governmental agency or local government, special district, or other political subdivision or official, agent, or employee of such state or other governmental entity or any other person, private or public, shall accumulate, compile, computerize, or otherwise collect or convert such written records into any form of list, registry, or database for any purpose.
(e)1.Records kept pursuant to the recordkeeping provisions of s. 790.065; however, nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the public release or inspection of records that are made confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) by s. 790.065(4)(a).
2.Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to allow the maintaining of records containing the names of purchasers or transferees who receive unique approval numbers or the maintaining of records of firearm transactions.
(f)Firearm records, including paper pawn transaction forms and contracts on firearm transactions, required by chapters 538 and 539.
1.Electronic firearm records held pursuant to chapter 538 may only be kept by a secondhand dealer for 30 days after the date of the purchase of the firearm by the secondhand dealer.
2.Electronic firearm records held pursuant to chapter 539 may only be kept by a pawnbroker for 30 days after the expiration of the loan that is secured by a firearm or 30 days after the date of purchase of a firearm, whichever is applicable.

4.Notwithstanding subparagraph 3., secondhand dealers and pawnbrokers may electronically submit firearm transaction records to the appropriate law enforcement agencies as required by chapters 538 and 539; however, the law enforcement agencies may not electronically submit such records to any other person or entity and must destroy such records within 60 days after receipt of such records.
5.Notwithstanding subparagraph 3., secondhand dealers and pawnbrokers may electronically submit limited firearms records consisting solely of the manufacturer, model, serial number, and caliber of pawned or purchased firearms to a third-party private provider that is exclusively incorporated, exclusively owned, and exclusively operated in the United States and that restricts access to such information to only appropriate law enforcement agencies for legitimate law enforcement purposes. Such records must be destroyed within 30 days by the third-party provider. As a condition of receipt of such records, the third-party provider must agree in writing to comply with the requirements of this section. Any pawnbroker or secondhand dealer who contracts with a third-party provider other than as provided in this act or electronically transmits any records of firearms transactions to any third-party provider other than the records specifically allowed by this paragraph commits a felony of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.

I of the State Constitution or the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, no public funds shall be used to defend the unlawful conduct of any person charged with a violation of this section, unless the charges against such person are dismissed or such person is determined to be not guilty at trial. Notwithstanding this paragraph, public funds may be expended to provide the services of the office of public defender or court-appointed conflict counsel as provided by law.
(c)The governmental entity, or the designee of such governmental entity, in whose service or employ a list, record, or registry was compiled in violation of this section may be assessed a fine of not more than $5 million, if the court determines that the evidence shows that the list, record, or registry was compiled or maintained with the knowledge or complicity of the management of the governmental entity.

790.338Medical privacy concerning firearms; prohibitions; penalties; exceptions.—
(1)A health care practitioner licensed under chapter 456 or a health care facility licensed under chapter 395 may not intentionally enter any disclosed information concerning firearm ownership into the patient’s medical record if the practitioner knows that such information is not relevant to the patient’s medical care or safety, or the safety of others.
(2)A health care practitioner licensed under chapter 456 or a health care facility licensed under chapter 395 shall respect a patient’s right to privacy and should refrain from making a written inquiry or asking questions concerning the ownership of a firearm or ammunition by the patient or by a family member of the patient, or the presence of a firearm in a private home or other domicile of the patient or a family member of the patient. Notwithstanding this provision, a health care practitioner or health care facility that in good faith believes that this information is relevant to the patient’s medical care or safety, or the safety of others, may make such a verbal or written inquiry.
(3)Any emergency medical technician or paramedic acting under the supervision of an emergency medical services medical director under chapter 401 may make an inquiry concerning the possession or presence of a firearm if he or she, in good faith, believes that information regarding the possession of a firearm by the patient or the presence of a firearm in the home or domicile of a patient or a patient’s family member is necessary to treat a patient during the course and scope of a medical emergency or that the presence or possession of a firearm would pose an imminent danger or threat to the patient or others.
(4)A patient may decline to answer or provide any information regarding ownership of a firearm by the patient or a family member of the patient, or the presence of a firearm in the domicile of the patient or a family member of the patient. A patient’s decision not to answer a question relating to the presence or ownership of a firearm does not alter existing law regarding a physician’s authorization to choose his or her patients.
(5)A health care practitioner licensed under chapter 456 or a health care facility licensed under chapter 395 may not discriminate against a patient based solely upon the patient’s exercise of the constitutional right to own and possess firearms or ammunition.

(7)An insurer issuing any type of insurance policy pursuant to chapter 627 may not deny coverage, increase any premium, or otherwise discriminate against any insured or applicant for insurance on the basis of or upon reliance upon the lawful ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition or the lawful use or storage of a firearm or ammunition. Nothing herein shall prevent an insurer from considering the fair market value of firearms or ammunition in the setting of premiums for scheduled personal property coverage.
(8)Violations of the provisions of subsections (1)-(4) constitute grounds for disciplinary action under ss. 456.072(2) and 395.1055.

However, if, after notice, the motion for extension is uncontested and no modification of the order is sought, the order may be extended on the basis of a motion or affidavit stating that there has been no material change in relevant circumstances since entry of the order and stating the reason for the requested extension.
4.The court may extend a risk protection order for a period that it deems appropriate, up to and including but not exceeding 12 months, subject to an order to vacate as provided in paragraph (a) or to another extension order by the court.
(7)SURRENDER OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION.—
(a)Upon issuance of a risk protection order under this section, including a temporary ex parte risk protection order, the court shall order the respondent to surrender to the local law enforcement agency all firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent in the respondent’s custody, control, or possession except as provided in subsection (9), and any license to carry a concealed weapon or firearm issued under s. 790.06, held by the respondent.
(b)The law enforcement officer serving a risk protection order under this section, including a temporary ex parte risk protection order, shall request that the respondent immediately surrender all firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent in his or her custody, control, or possession and any license to carry a concealed weapon or firearm issued under s. 790.06, held by the respondent. The law enforcement officer shall take possession of all firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent and any license to carry a concealed weapon or firearm issued under s. 790.06, held by the respondent, which are surrendered. Alternatively, if personal service by a law enforcement officer is not possible or is not required because the respondent was present at the risk protection order hearing, the respondent must surrender any firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent and any license to carry a concealed weapon or firearm issued under s. 790.06, held by the respondent, in a safe manner to the control of the local law enforcement agency immediately after being served with the order by service or immediately after the hearing at which the respondent was present. Notwithstanding ss. 933.02 and 933.18, a law enforcement officer may seek a search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction to conduct a search for firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent if the officer has probable cause to believe that there are firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent in the respondent’s custody, control, or possession which have not been surrendered.
(c)At the time of surrender, a law enforcement officer taking possession of any firearm or ammunition owned by the respondent, or a license to carry a concealed weapon or firearm issued under s. 790.06, held by the respondent shall issue a receipt identifying all firearms and the quantity and type of ammunition that have been surrendered, and any license surrendered and shall provide a copy of the receipt to the respondent. Within 72 hours after service of the order, the law enforcement officer serving the order shall file the original receipt with the court and shall ensure that his or her law enforcement agency retains a copy of the receipt.
(d)Notwithstanding ss. 933.02 and 933.18, upon the sworn statement or testimony of any person alleging that the respondent has failed to comply with the surrender of firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent, as required by an order issued under this section, the court shall determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the respondent has failed to surrender all firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent in the respondent’s custody, control, or possession. If the court finds that probable cause exists, the court must issue a warrant describing the firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent and authorizing a search of the locations where the firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent are reasonably believed to be found and the seizure of any firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent discovered pursuant to such search.
(e)If a person other than the respondent claims title to any firearms or ammunition surrendered pursuant to this section and he or she is determined by the law enforcement agency to be the lawful owner of the firearm or ammunition, the firearm or ammunition shall be returned to him or her, if:
1.The lawful owner agrees to store the firearm or ammunition in a manner such that the respondent does not have access to or control of the firearm or ammunition.
2.The firearm or ammunition is not otherwise unlawfully possessed by the owner.
(f)Upon the issuance of a risk protection order, the court shall order a new hearing date and require the respondent to appear no later than 3 business days after the issuance of the order. The court shall require proof that the respondent has surrendered any firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent in the respondent’s custody, control, or possession. The court may cancel the hearing upon a satisfactory showing that the respondent is in compliance with the order.
(g)All law enforcement agencies must develop policies and procedures regarding the acceptance, storage, and return of firearms, ammunition, or licenses required to be surrendered under this section.
(8)RETURN AND DISPOSAL OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION.—
(a)If a risk protection order is vacated or ends without extension, a law enforcement agency holding a firearm or any ammunition owned by the respondent or a license to carry a concealed weapon or firearm issued under s. 790.06, held by the respondent, that has been surrendered or seized pursuant to this section must return such surrendered firearm, ammunition, or license to carry a concealed weapon or firearm issued under s. 790.06, as requested by a respondent only after confirming through a background check that the respondent is currently eligible to own or possess firearms and ammunition under federal and state law and after confirming with the court that the risk protection order has been vacated or has ended without extension.
(b)If a risk protection order is vacated or ends without extension, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, if it has suspended a license to carry a concealed weapon or firearm pursuant to this section, must reinstate such license only after confirming that the respondent is currently eligible to have a license to carry a concealed weapon or firearm pursuant to s. 790.06.
(c)A law enforcement agency must provide notice to any family or household members of the respondent before the return of any surrendered firearm and ammunition owned by the respondent.
(d)Any firearm and ammunition surrendered by a respondent pursuant to subsection (7) which remains unclaimed for 1 year by the lawful owner after an order to vacate the risk protection order shall be disposed of in accordance with the law enforcement agency’s policies and procedures for the disposal of firearms in police custody.
(9)TRANSFER OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION.—A respondent may elect to transfer all firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent that have been surrendered to or seized by a local law enforcement agency pursuant to subsection (7) to another person who is willing to receive the respondent’s firearms and ammunition. The law enforcement agency must allow such a transfer only if it is determined that the chosen recipient:
(a)Currently is eligible to own or possess a firearm and ammunition under federal and state law after confirmation through a background check;
(b)Attests to storing the firearms and ammunition in a manner such that the respondent does not have access to or control of the firearms and ammunition until the risk protection order against the respondent is vacated or ends without extension; and
(c)Attests not to transfer the firearms or ammunition back to the respondent until the risk protection order against the respondent is vacated or ends without extension.
(10)REPORTING OF ORDERS.—
(a)Within 24 hours after issuance, the clerk of the court shall enter any risk protection order or temporary ex parte risk protection order issued under this section into the uniform case reporting system.
(b)Within 24 hours after issuance, the clerk of the court shall forward a copy of an order issued under this section to the appropriate law enforcement agency specified in the order. Upon receipt of the copy of the order, the law enforcement agency shall enter the order into the Florida Crime Information Center and National Crime Information Center. The order must remain in each system for the period stated in the order, and the law enforcement agency may only remove an order from the systems which has ended or been vacated. Entry of the order into the Florida Crime Information Center and National Crime Information Center constitutes notice to all law enforcement agencies of the existence of the order. The order is fully enforceable in any county in this state.
(c)The issuing court shall, within 3 business days after issuance of a risk protection order or temporary ex parte risk protection order, forward all available identifying information concerning the respondent, along with the date of order issuance, to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Upon receipt of the information, the department shall determine if the respondent has a license to carry a concealed weapon or firearm. If the respondent does have a license to carry a concealed weapon or firearm, the department must immediately suspend the license.
(d)If a risk protection order is vacated before its end date, the clerk of the court shall, on the day of the order to vacate, forward a copy of the order to the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and the appropriate law enforcement agency specified in the order to vacate. Upon receipt of the order, the law enforcement agency shall promptly remove the order from any computer-based system in which it was entered pursuant to paragraph (b).
(11)PENALTIES.—
(a)A person who makes a false statement, which he or she does not believe to be true, under oath in a hearing under this section in regard to any material matter commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.
(b)A person who has in his or her custody or control a firearm or any ammunition or who purchases, possesses, or receives a firearm or any ammunition with knowledge that he or she is prohibited from doing so by an order issued under this section commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.

893.035Control of new substances; findings of fact; delegation of authority to Attorney General to control substances by rule.—
(1)(a)New substances are being created which are not controlled under the provisions of this chapter but which have a potential for abuse similar to or greater than that for substances controlled under this chapter. These new substances are sometimes called “designer drugs” because they can be designed to produce a desired pharmacological effect and to evade the controlling statutory provisions. Designer drugs are being manufactured, distributed, possessed, and used as substitutes for controlled substances.
(b)The hazards attributable to the traffic in and use of these designer drugs are increased because their unregulated manufacture produces variations in purity and concentration.
(c)Many such new substances are untested, and it cannot be immediately determined whether they have useful medical or chemical purposes.
(d)The uncontrolled importation, manufacture, distribution, possession, or use of these designer drugs has a substantial and detrimental impact on the health and safety of the people of Florida.
(e)These designer drugs can be created more rapidly than they can be identified and controlled by action of the Legislature. There is a need for a speedy and expert administrative determination of their proper classification under this chapter. It is therefore necessary to delegate to an administrative agency restricted authority to identify and classify new substances that have a potential for abuse, so that they can be controlled in the same manner as other substances currently controlled under this chapter.
(2)The Attorney General shall apply the provisions of this section to any substance not currently controlled under the provisions of s. 893.03. The Attorney General may by rule:
(a)Add a substance to a schedule established by s. 893.03, or transfer a substance between schedules, if he or she finds that it has a potential for abuse and he or she makes with respect to it the other findings appropriate for classification in the particular schedule under s. 893.03 in which it is to be placed.
(b)Remove a substance previously added to a schedule if he or she finds the substance does not meet the requirements for inclusion in that schedule.
Rules adopted under this section shall be made pursuant to the rulemaking procedures prescribed by chapter 120.

(3)(a)The term “potential for abuse” in this section means that a substance has properties as a central nervous system stimulant or depressant or a hallucinogen that create a substantial likelihood of its being:
1.Used in amounts that create a hazard to the user’s health or the safety of the community;
2.Diverted from legal channels and distributed through illegal channels; or
3.Taken on the user’s own initiative rather than on the basis of professional medical advice.
Proof of potential for abuse can be based upon a showing that these activities are already taking place, or upon a showing that the nature and properties of the substance make it reasonable to assume that there is a substantial likelihood that such activities will take place, in other than isolated or occasional instances.

(b)The terms “immediate precursor” and “narcotic drug” shall be given the same meanings as provided by s. 102 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. s. 802, as amended and in effect on April 1, 1985.
(4)In making any findings under this section, the Attorney General shall consider the following factors with respect to each substance proposed to be controlled or removed from control:
(a)Its actual or relative potential for abuse.
(b)Scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if known.
(c)The state of current scientific knowledge regarding the drug or other substance.
(d)Its history and current pattern of abuse.
(e)The scope, duration, and significance of abuse.
(f)What, if any, risk there is to the public health.
(g)Its psychic or physiological dependence liability.
(h)Whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under this chapter.
The findings and conclusions of the United States Attorney General or his or her delegee, as set forth in the Federal Register, with respect to any substance pursuant to s. 201 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. s. 811, as amended and in effect on April 1, 1985, shall be admissible as evidence in any rulemaking proceeding under this section, including an emergency rulemaking proceeding under subsection (7).

(5)Before initiating proceedings under subsection (2), the Attorney General shall request from the Department of Health and the Department of Law Enforcement a medical and scientific evaluation of the substance under consideration and a recommendation as to the appropriate classification, if any, of such substance as a controlled substance. In responding to this request, the Department of Health and the Department of Law Enforcement shall consider the factors listed in subsection (4). The Department of Health and the Department of Law Enforcement shall respond to this request promptly and in writing; however, their response is not subject to chapter 120. If both the Department of Health and the Department of Law Enforcement recommend that a substance not be controlled, the Attorney General shall not control that substance. If the Attorney General determines, based on the evaluations and recommendations of the Department of Health and the Department of Law Enforcement and all other available evidence, that there is substantial evidence of potential for abuse, he or she shall initiate proceedings under paragraph (2)(a) with respect to that substance.
(6)(a)The Attorney General shall by rule exempt any nonnarcotic substance controlled by rule under this section from the application of this section if such substance may, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, be lawfully sold over the counter without a prescription.
(b)The Attorney General may by rule exempt any compound, mixture, or preparation containing a substance controlled by rule under this section from the application of this section if he or she finds that such compound, mixture, or preparation meets the requirements of either of the following subcategories:
1.A mixture or preparation containing a nonnarcotic substance controlled by rule, which mixture or preparation is approved for prescription use and which contains one or more other active ingredients which are not listed in any schedule and which are included therein in such combinations, quantity, proportion, or concentration as to vitiate the potential for abuse.
2.A compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any substance controlled by rule, which is not for administration to a human being or animal, and which is packaged in such form or concentration, or with adulterants or denaturants, so that as packaged it does not present any significant potential for abuse.
(7)(a)If the Attorney General finds that the scheduling of a substance in Schedule I of s. 893.03 on a temporary basis is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety, he or she may by rule and without regard to the requirements of subsection (5) relating to the Department of Health and the Department of Law Enforcement schedule such substance in Schedule I if the substance is not listed in any other schedule of s. 893.03. The Attorney General shall be required to consider, with respect to his or her finding of imminent hazard to the public safety, only those factors set forth in paragraphs (3)(a) and (4)(d), (e), and (f), including actual abuse, diversion from legitimate channels, and clandestine importation, manufacture, or distribution.
(b)The Attorney General may use emergency rulemaking provisions under s. 120.54(4) in scheduling substances under this subsection. Notwithstanding the provisions of s. 120.54(4)(c), any rule adopted under this subsection shall not expire except as provided in subsection (9).
(8)(a)Upon the effective date of a rule adopted pursuant to this section adding or transferring a substance to a schedule under s. 893.03, such substance shall be deemed included in that schedule, and all provisions of this chapter applicable to substances in that schedule shall be deemed applicable to such substance.
(b)A rule adopted pursuant to this section shall continue in effect until it is repealed; until it is declared invalid in proceedings under s. 120.56 or in proceedings before a court of competent jurisdiction; or until it expires under the provisions of subsection (9).
(9)The Attorney General shall report to the Legislature by March 1 of each year concerning the rules adopted under this section during the previous year. Each rule so reported shall expire on the following June 30 unless the Legislature adopts the provisions thereof as an amendment to this chapter.
(10)The repeal, expiration, or determination of invalidity of any rule shall not operate to create any claim or cause of action against any law enforcement officer or other enforcing authority for actions taken in good faith in reliance on the validity of the rule.
(11)In construing this section, due consideration and great weight should be given to interpretations of the United States Attorney General and the federal courts relating to s. 201 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. s. 811, as amended and in effect on April 1, 1985. All substantive rules adopted under this part shall not be inconsistent with the rules of the United States Attorney General and the decisions of the federal courts interpreting the provisions of s. 201 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. s. 811, as amended and in effect on April 1, 1985.
(12)The adoption of a rule transferring a substance from one schedule to another or removing a substance from a schedule pursuant to this section shall not affect prosecution or punishment for any crime previously committed with respect to that substance.

893.0355Control of scheduled substances; delegation of authority to Attorney General to reschedule substance, or delete substance, by rule.—
(1)The Legislature has determined that, from time to time, additional testings, approvals, or scientific evidence may indicate that controlled substances listed in Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V hereof have a greater potential for beneficial medical use in treatment in the United States than was evident when such substances were initially scheduled. It is the intent of the Legislature to quickly provide a method for an immediate change to the scheduling and control of such substances to allow for the beneficial medical use thereof so that more flexibility will be available than is possible through rescheduling legislatively.
(2)The Attorney General is hereby delegated the authority to adopt rules rescheduling specified substances to a less controlled schedule, or deleting specified substances from a schedule, upon a finding that reduced control of such substances is in the public interest. In determining whether reduced control of a substance is in the public interest, the Attorney General shall consider the following:
(a)Whether the substance has been rescheduled or deleted from any schedule by rule adopted by the United States Attorney General pursuant to s. 201 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. s. 811.
(b)The substance’s actual or relative potential for abuse.
(c)Scientific evidence of the substance’s pharmacological effect, if known.
(d)The state of current scientific knowledge regarding the substance.
(e)The substance’s history and current pattern of abuse.
(f)The scope, duration, and significance of abuse.
(g)What, if any, risk there is to the public health.
(h)The substance’s psychic or physiological dependence liability.
(3)In making the public interest determination, the Attorney General shall give great weight to the scheduling rules adopted by the United States Attorney General subsequent to such substances being listed in Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V hereof, to achieve the original legislative purpose of the Florida Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of maintaining uniformity between the laws of Florida and the laws of the United States with respect to controlled substances.
(4)Rulemaking under this section shall be in accordance with the procedural requirements of chapter 120, including the emergency rule provisions found in s. 120.54, except that s. 120.54(7) does not apply.
(5)Upon the effective date of a rule adopted pursuant to this section, the rule’s rescheduling or deletion of a substance shall be effective for all purposes under this chapter.
(6)Rules adopted pursuant to this section shall be reviewed each year by the Legislature. Each rule shall remain in effect until the effective date of legislation that provides for a different scheduling of a substance than that set forth in such rule.
(7)The adoption of a rule rescheduling a substance or deleting a substance from control pursuant to this section shall not affect prosecution or punishment for any crime previously committed with respect to that substance.
(8)The provisions of this section apply only to substances controlled expressly by statute and not to substances controlled by rules adopted under the authority granted in the provisions of s. 893.035.

893.0356Control of new substances; findings of fact; “controlled substance analog” defined.—
(1)(a)New substances are being created which are not controlled under the provisions of this chapter but which have a potential for abuse similar to or greater than that for substances controlled under this chapter. These new substances are called “controlled substance analogs,” and can be designed to produce a desired pharmacological effect and to evade the controlling statutory provisions. Controlled substance analogs are being manufactured, distributed, possessed, and used as substitutes for controlled substances.
(b)The hazards attributable to the traffic in and use of controlled substance analogs are increased because their unregulated manufacture produces variations in purity and concentration.
(c)Many such new substances are untested, and it cannot be immediately determined whether they have useful medical or chemical purposes.
(d)The uncontrolled importation, manufacture, distribution, possession, or use of controlled substance analogs has a substantial and detrimental impact on the health and safety of the people of Florida.
(e)Controlled substance analogs can be created more rapidly than they can be identified and controlled by action of the Legislature. There is a need for a speedy determination of their proper classification under this chapter. It is therefore necessary to identify and classify new substances that have a potential for abuse, so that they can be controlled in the same manner as other substances currently controlled under this chapter.
(2)(a)As used in this section, “controlled substance analog” means a substance which, due to its chemical structure and potential for abuse, meets the following criteria:
1.Is substantially similar to that of a controlled substance listed in Schedule I or Schedule II of s. 893.03; and
2.Has a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system or is represented or intended to have a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system substantially similar to or greater than that of a controlled substance listed in Schedule I or Schedule II of s. 893.03.
(b)“Controlled substance analog” does not include:
1.A controlled substance;
2.Any substance for which there is an approved new drug application;
3.Any compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any controlled substance which is not for administration to a human being or animal, and which is packaged in such form or concentration, or with adulterants or denaturants, so that as packaged it does not present any significant potential for abuse; or
4.Any substance to which an investigational exemption applies under s. 505 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, but only to the extent that conduct with respect to the substance is pursuant to such exemption.
(3)As used in this section, the term “substantially similar,” as the term applies to the chemical structure of a substance, means that the chemical structure of the substance compared to the structure of a controlled substance has a single difference in the structural formula that substitutes one atom or functional group for another, including, but not limited to, one halogen for another halogen, one hydrogen for a halogen or vice versa, an alkyl group added or deleted as a side chain to or from a molecule, or an alkyl group added or deleted from a side chain of a molecule.
(4)The following factors shall be relevant to a finding that a substance is a controlled substance analog within the purview of this section:
(a)Its actual or relative potential for abuse.
(b)Scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if known.
(c)The state of current scientific knowledge regarding the substance.
(d)Its history and current pattern of abuse.
(e)The scope, duration, and significance of abuse.
(f)What, if any, risk there is to the public health.
(g)Its psychic or physiological dependence liability.
(h)Its diversion from legitimate channels, and clandestine importation, manufacture, or distribution.
(i)Whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under this chapter.
(j)Comparisons to the accepted methods of marketing, distribution, and sales of the substance and that which the substance is purported to be, including, but not limited to:
1.The difference in price at which the substance is sold and the price at which the substance it is purported to be or advertised as is normally sold;
2.The difference in how the substance is imported, manufactured, or distributed compared to how the substance it is purported to be or advertised as is normally imported, manufactured, or distributed;
3.The difference in the appearance of the substance in overall finished dosage form compared to the substance it is purported to be or advertised as normally appears in overall finished dosage form; and
4.The difference in how the substance is labeled for sale, packaged for sale, or the method of sale, including, but not limited to, the placement of the substance in an area commonly viewable to the public for purchase consideration compared to how the substance it is purported to be or advertised as is normally labeled for sale, packaged for sale, or sold to the public.
(5)A controlled substance analog shall, for purposes of drug abuse prevention and control, be treated as the highest scheduled controlled substance of which it is a controlled substance analog in s. 893.03.
(6)In construing this section, due consideration and great weight should be given to interpretations of the United States Attorney General and the federal courts relating to s. 201 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. s. 811, as amended and in effect on April 1, 1985. New substances controlled under this section shall not be treated in a manner inconsistent with the rules of the United States Attorney General and the decisions of the federal courts interpreting the provisions of s. 201 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. s. 811, as amended and in effect on April 1, 1985.
(7)The treatment of a new substance as a controlled substance pursuant to this section shall not affect prosecution or punishment for any crime previously committed with respect to that substance.

5.The name of the patient for whom, or of the owner and species of the animal for which, the controlled substance is prescribed.
6.The directions for the use of the controlled substance prescribed in the prescription.
7.A clear, concise warning that it is a crime to transfer the controlled substance to any person other than the patient for whom prescribed.
(f)A prescription for a controlled substance listed in Schedule II may be dispensed only upon a written or electronic prescription of a practitioner, except that in an emergency situation, as defined by regulation of the Department of Health, such controlled substance may be dispensed upon oral prescription but is limited to a 72-hour supply. A prescription for a controlled substance listed in Schedule II may not be refilled.
(g)A prescription for a controlled substance listed in Schedule III, Schedule IV, or Schedule V may not be filled or refilled more than five times within a period of 6 months after the date on which the prescription was written unless the prescription is renewed by a practitioner.
(2)(a)A pharmacist may not dispense a controlled substance listed in Schedule II, Schedule III, or Schedule IV to any patient or patient’s agent without first determining, in the exercise of her or his professional judgment, that the prescription is valid. The pharmacist may dispense the controlled substance, in the exercise of her or his professional judgment, when the pharmacist or pharmacist’s agent has obtained satisfactory patient information from the patient or the patient’s agent.
(b)Any pharmacist who dispenses by mail a controlled substance listed in Schedule II, Schedule III, or Schedule IV is exempt from the requirement to obtain suitable identification for the prescription dispensed by mail if the pharmacist has obtained the patient’s identification through the patient’s prescription benefit plan.
(c)Any controlled substance listed in Schedule III or Schedule IV may be dispensed by a pharmacist upon an oral prescription if, before filling the prescription, the pharmacist reduces it to writing or records the prescription electronically if permitted by federal law.

893.101Legislative findings and intent.—

State, 684 So.2d 736 (Fla. 1996), holding that the state must prove that the defendant knew of the illicit nature of a controlled substance found in his or her actual or constructive possession, were contrary to legislative intent.

A state agency shall initiate an immediate emergency suspension of an individual professional license issued by the agency, in compliance with the procedures for summary suspensions in s. 120.60(6), upon the agency’s findings of the licensee’s conviction in any court reported to the Comprehensive Case Information System of the Florida Association of Court Clerks and Comptrollers, Inc., for the sale of, or trafficking in, a controlled substance, or for conspiracy to sell, or traffic in, a controlled substance. Before renewing any professional license, a state agency that issues a professional license must use the Comprehensive Case Information System of the Florida Association of Court Clerks and Comptrollers, Inc., to obtain information relating to any conviction for the sale of, or trafficking in, a controlled substance or for conspiracy to sell, or traffic in, a controlled substance. The clerk of court shall provide electronic access to each state agency at no cost and also provide certified copies of the judgment upon request to the agency.

(a)Any person who knowingly sells, purchases, manufactures, delivers, or brings into this state, or who is knowingly in actual or constructive possession of, in excess of 25 pounds of cannabis, or 300 or more cannabis plants, commits a felony of the first degree, which felony shall be known as “trafficking in cannabis,” punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. If the quantity of cannabis involved:
1.Is in excess of 25 pounds, but less than 2,000 pounds, or is 300 or more cannabis plants, but not more than 2,000 cannabis plants, such person shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 3 years, and the defendant shall be ordered to pay a fine of $25,000.

The judge hearing the motion may reduce or suspend the sentence if the judge finds that the defendant rendered such substantial assistance.
(5)Any person who agrees, conspires, combines, or confederates with another person to commit any act prohibited by subsection (1) commits a felony of the first degree and is punishable as if he or she had actually committed such prohibited act.

If there is more than one mixture containing the same controlled substance, the weight of the controlled substance is calculated by aggregating the total weight of each mixture.
(7)For the purpose of further clarifying legislative intent, the Legislature finds that the opinion in Hayes v. State, 750 So. 2d 1 (Fla. 1999) does not correctly construe legislative intent. The Legislature finds that the opinions in State v. Hayes, 720 So. 2d 1095 (Fla. 4th DCA 1998) and State v. Baxley, 684 So. 2d 831 (Fla. 5th DCA 1996) correctly construe legislative intent.

Any employee, officer, or resident of the county or municipality may bring a complaint before the board after giving not less than 3 days’ written notice of such complaint to the owner of the place or premises at his or her last known address. After a hearing in which the board may consider any evidence, including evidence of the general reputation of the place or premises, and at which the owner of the premises shall have an opportunity to present evidence in his or her defense, the board may declare the place or premises to be a public nuisance as described in subsection (2).

Where a local government seeks to bring an administrative action, based on a stolen property nuisance, against a property owner operating an establishment where multiple tenants, on one site, conduct their own retail business, the property owner shall not be subject to a lien against his or her property or the prohibition of operation provision if the property owner evicts the business declared to be a nuisance within 90 days after notification by registered mail to the property owner of a second stolen property conviction of the tenant. The total fines imposed pursuant to the authority of this section shall not exceed $15,000. Nothing contained within this section prohibits a county or municipality from proceeding against a public nuisance by any other means.
